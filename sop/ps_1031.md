It was in 2014 that I first set my foot in industry. Through the experience in a startup company, I applied the theoretical knowledge I learnt in school into practice and germinated the idea of setting up my own business.

To meet the requirement of rapid development, I found a quick and effective way to learn programming. I invited other developers in the company to review my pull requests and help me find the implicit problems in the code. Through in-depth discussions with them, I gained confidence to share my own understanding and question their proposals adequately. I remembered my first code review lasted for ten iterations and the problems behind it like coding styles, class definition and resource file structure provided me with an impressive lesson. In the two-month internship, I found my passion for programming as well as learnt numerous coding skills, which notably reduced the review iteration to two times.

In addition to technological improvement, I learnt a lot in how to serve as a leader in a startup from my friend who was also the CTO of the company. I realized that being the person in charge required not only a strong problem-solving ability, but a precise overview and judgment of the products as well. For example, in order to collect more feedbacks, I integrated the user systems of two third-party application distribution platforms; as the growth of the users, I embedded and customized a monitoring system to collect bug information. This series of actions led to an accurate delivery to the app market and heated responses from the target users. With the united efforts of five developers, the company's first mobile game had once ranked 13th of all the paid games in Apple's App Store.

After one year's preparation and rounds of selection, I got the opportunity to start a new journey in a company with totally different styles. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was to publish documents from a git repository, relying heavily on GitHub service. Thanks to my acquaintance with it, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

At Microsoft, there were plenty of experienced engineers who were willing to share their opinions and in such environment I developed the ability to see the root of a problem and figure out the most direct way to solve it. For example, I encountered a problem when I was using an internal library to build a command-line tool. Through contacting with several other teams, I found the author of the library, opened an issue to report the situation directly. In the issue, I audaciously expressed my real expectation to the library, and received a clear and positive reply. The author also kindly provided me with a workaround, saving at least 3 hours trawling through the documentation.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering play in helping the huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of Computer Science technology. I believe that the familiarity with open-source technology will also be a huge boost to me during the study at Carnegie Mellon.

With these professional experiences in hand, I think I'm ready for my graduate study in MSBIC program. The practice in the startup cultivates my innovation in thinking and perseverance in facing difficulties; while the technology giants experience hones my ability in critical thinking and finding solutions. They both give me confidence and faith to be a good leader in a software project, or even an integral business plan, which guarantees my performance in the core curriculums.

I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at Carnegie Mellon and feel confident that MSBIC is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential.
