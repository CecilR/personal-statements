# PS3.0 Why I am qualified for my dream school

I will choose three aspects to demostrate why I am qualified for my dream school CMU.

First, interests. I get in touch with computer programming in my junior school though it was only some simple GUI programming like Labview. But since that time, I was attracted by those mysterious symbol that can make the LOGO robots run by the black lines. I wrote my first C program in the second year of high school. Then I used my program to gain the first prize in a teenager innovation competition. This series of success makes me more and more addicted to programming. I even gave up the chance to enter a better school in my university, instead of admitted to the College of Software Engineering. After three years' professionl studying in college, I decide to be a programmer out of interests and I always believe interests makes perfect.

Second, ability. During my four college years, I ranks the first in the college and scores A in most of the profession course, such as Data Structure, Operating System and Fundamentals of Compiling. I practise a lot in my college years as well. I took part in the hackShanghai hackathon, and got the second prize out of the 60 teams from all over the world. In the competition, there are only two day's time and the team should deal with design, coding, testing and presentation. As the team leader, I should be responsible not only for my part of coding but the quality of the whole project as well. The competition also tests the communication skills and the psychological quality of the contestants. In the final round, the team should show their products in front of all of the audience  in English without preparation. I was so lucky to resist the pressure and show the best of both the products and me. Besides engineering skills, I also explore my ability in research. I have published a paper in CEC, which is a famous conference in evolutionary computing as the first author. I think I may not be the strongest, but at least one of them.

Third, determination. The goal of the master of CS in CMU is to cultivate qualified talent for the IT enterprises. And my goal is also to be a great programmer in the industrial field. The matchness gives me the determination of being selected by this program. Also I have a great passion in programming and want to devote myself to it. During the days I doing my first linux programming projects, there was a function required for multithreading and multiprocessing. I haven't any related experience before, also no member in my team has either. But I decide to figure it out no matter how difficult it is. Eventually, with the help of teacher and internet, my codes worked well and it help my team to be the top three in the final selection.

For all three reasons above, I have confidence that, I am qualified for my dream school CMU, and hope my efforts can make my dream come true.
