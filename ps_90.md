# Personal Statement

I clearly remember the situation when I first took part in software development contest. It was the first summer vocation in college. I set up a team with other two classmates. Since we all lived in different places, we failed to find a way to share our work. Therefore, a project required 3 people's together work became three lonely projects. Everyone wants his/her work to represent the all, but no one actually can. The project failed with no doubt.

I was born in a lonely time in China. From the very beginning, since I first received education, I was told to protect what 'belongs to' me. I read lonely books, learnt lonely knowledge and played lonely games. After 12 years, when I came to the college, I didn't have a chance to truly cooperate with others. That failure shocked me, and pushed me to think about how to share.

As a typical engineerin student, I first came up to the idea of solving it in technological way. In my next team project, I began to use git to cooperate with other team members. At first, they feel so reluctant to this tool, even thought it will slow down the process, but under my urge and instruction, they started to use git fluently and willingly. I felt so satisfied when my methods worked well. With this high-efficience cooperation pattern, we managed to programmed 30 thousands lines of code in 2 weeks and our projects also won the first prize.

The biggest turnpoint to me is on Jul.15th 2013. On that common day, I joined Github community, which is the biggest worldwide Open Source Community. Since that day, I have spent more than 30% of my lifetime on it, enjoy the profit from the Open Source Community. When I required a tool to improve my efficiency in some particular aspect, I first searched on Github to see whether there have already existed to meet my demands. When I encountered a problem in using a Open Source Library, I can directly ask the author through opening an issue under this project and always receive a warm and patient response.

Github offered me chances to test and improve my real programming ability. In my first internship in a startup company, they managed their code on the Github. I contributed my code by using opening pull requests and they will leave comments on my code to help me improve. During that period, I improved quickly in programming. Computer Science is a practical science which requires its practitionor to do more than speak. When I was a freshman in ACM club, one of my fellow students told me that everything he leanrt during college, including Operacting Systems, Data Structure and so on, all became his understanding to the programming. I am quite agree with this idead because in Computer Science, whatever ideas you have made, you have to represent it in code. Programming is not only a way to build softwares, but also a language for programmers to communicate effectively.

However, the most important thing I learnt in this community is not the technology, but the spirits of Open Source. I enjoyed the atmosphere where everyone can share their interests, propose their opinions and communicate with each other freely and equally. I admire spirits of Open Source, because I consider it as a huge boost for technology advancement. For example, in the recent three years, frontend technology develop quickly, one reason is for the demands, but a more importent reason is due to the Open Source. Javascript, which is the current dominant developing language in frontend, has award the third year of The Most Popular Language on Github.

Influence by the spirits of Open Source, I wished to become a independent developer in the Open Source Community, who is able to maintain a famous project which benefits thousands of programmers. This is also the reason why I want to going abroad. America has the most open air of technology around world. This pure technological environment is every engineer's dream.

The spirits of Open Source also benefits in research. During my time in lab, I participated acitvely in the group discussion held twice a month with the graduate students. I was inspired by the idea they share. I also gave a talk about the recent paper I have read which raised a hot discussion. Research is still a relatively close field in Computer Science. Things are starting to change. There are more and more researchers open-source their experiment data on Github as well as more and more open-source implementation of the famous methods, such as A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python. During my research, I aslo putting my implementation of algorithms on Github, maybe someday, this simple action can benefit others

Spending most of my time in doing Open Source projects doesn't equal to a bad performance in class. I ranked one in the college with my strong focus on the lessons and some talents in programming. I only do some combing work of knowledge out of class. Computer Science is clearly a hierarchical science. In every level of it, I usually first listed the original contradiction, which usually contains a general balance, like space and time, as well as some specific methods to deal with it. The original problem would induce to some small sub-contradictions, which also contains these elements. This efficient learning method guaranteed my further exploration in this field.

I love hackathon which I think it is a competition for only the young to show their talents. In my junior year, I teamed up with other three students to take part in hackShanghai, which was a feast for the hackers from all the top univerisities around country. We met each other on the Github through a project I started. Out of the same interests, we stayed up all night, busy dealing with constantly burst of inspiration. Though tired to barely stand in the end, I enjoyed every moment in the process. I can still hardly believe myself when I heard my team winning the second prize out of 60 competitve candidates.
