# PS 9.2

I clearly remember the situation when I first took part in a software development contest. Instead of working together, three young men, who failed to find a suitable way of cooperation, argued fiercely about whose project should be taken to compete, making a project required 3 people's joint effort into three individual projects. The competition hastily concluded in the end.

That failure shocked me and pushed me to think about what should be responsible for it. Before I came to the college, I didn't have a real chance to cooperate with others. I was born in an environment where everything should be done by myself. I read books alone, play games alone and faced challenges alone. Since I received education, I was told to protect what 'belongs to' me and not to share it with others. But the view is so different now.

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made a wise decision to join Github, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt nearly everything that is needed to be a qualified software engineer, from this community. What it gave to me truly exceeded my expectation.

Through Github, I tasted the happiness of collaboration in my next team project. In the beginning of development, because of its sudden appearance as well as strangeness to use, my teammates felt reluctant to it, even thinking it will slow down the developing process. However, under my serious urge and patient instruction, they started to embrace it gradually and willingly. As a result, our development speed rose linearly by our parallel work. I felt super satisfied that for the first time my partners and I can have a so tacit cooperation. With this high-efficiency cooperative mode, we managed to program 30 thousand lines of code in 2 weeks, making our projects won the first prize.

This community provides me with an effective way to learn quickly. During my internship in a startup company, I contributed my code by opening pull requests to their code repositories hosted on Github. Other developers would leave comments to help improve the quality of my code, and then I should refine it based on these comments. Through this unique way of learning, my programming ability has been a huge upgrade. At first, I usually need modify my code about 5-7 times to reach a final consensus, but within one month I joining this company, this number reduced to 2.

I overcame the fear of asking questions through communicating with others in the community. I encountered a problem when I was using a third-party library to build a command-line program during my internship at Microsoft. I found this project on Github and directly opened an issue to report the situation to its author. With the deepening of the discussion, I became bold to tell my real expectation to this library and got a satisfied response. The author also warmly provided with a way of workaround, saving at least 3 hours of time for me to understand the lengthy documentation.

After two years of persistence, now I have 26 original repositories on my Gihtub and 224 contributions to more than 15 projects on Github last year. My technology blog hosted on github.io was visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I got is not the enhancement of ability, but the acknowledgement to the spirit of Open Source. This spirits influenced me deeply in every aspect. I started to share my knowledge and experience. For example, I have opened more than 5 lectures in my department, sharing my successful experience about how to develop software in a team.

The spirits of Open Source also influenced in research. Academic research is still a relatively close field in Computer Science but things are starting to change. There is a growing trend for researchers to open-source their experiment data on Github, making their achievements more convincing. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods appeared, such as A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python, popularizing abstruse knowledge. These breakthroughs were greatly conducive for the development of Computer Science. To make my contribution, I also published my implementation and experiment data on Github. Maybe someday, this simple action can help those in need.

I found the same change happening gradually in big technology companies. At Microsoft, I work as a developer in Open Publishing Team (you could find this organization on Github, and I am the member of it) in MSDN China. Our product was an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, which strongly depends on Github service. On account of my acquaintance with this community, I soon became the main force of the team. During my six monthsâ€™ internship, I was involved in every corner related to the interaction with Github in the project. The huge amount of work did not beat me down, however, I gain much energy in doing what I love. On the all-hands meeting, Open Publishing was highly evaluated by Jeff, our new headmaster, and what I have done was demoed by my manager, receiving warm responses and constant applauses.

Though studying in the open-source world for a long time, I had to admit what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizon. The profession of software engineering, which I learnt most, permitted this huge machine to run quickly as well as stably nowadays. I found open-source community is a perfect match to these giant companies. Technology giants take advantage of the open-source technology and refine it to solve real-world problems; meanwhile, they contributed what they have achieved to make the community better. This powerful combination of creativity and rigor makes me look like a duck in water.

Influenced by this experience, my ideal career is to become a researcher in a big technology company, contributing my codes to the phenomenal open-source projects as well as putting these projects into real production to make profits for the company. I learn the information about this position in a session held by an open-source community in China. A researcher from Huawei, who specialized in applying Spark to the problem of huge data processing, shared what they were doing and how they work in usual time. I was fully fascinated by their expression then. After so many experiences accumulated, I finally figured out where I belong and I believe I will never regret for this decision.
