## Questions in application

### What are your research interests?

My research interest is in Artificial Intelligence, which specialize in Natural Language Processing. I am quite interested in this field because I want to make the current Artificial Intelligence, like Siri and Cortana, more humanize and smart.

### What is your research experience (including publications)?

I entered Associate Professor Qingjian Ni's lab in my freshman year at Southeast University. In my second year of college, I led a research group, applying Ant Colony Optimization to Robot Path Planning. We proposed a novel heterogeneous ACO algorithm to improve ACO's quality of solutions and performance in solving such problems. In the algorithm, we used two ant colony with different sensitivity to the pheromone and path selection strategies, and controlled their colony size by the stagnant rate of the searching situation, in order to avoid premature convergence. The experiment result of five comparative algorithms (ACS, MMACS, HFACO, BFS, Dijkstra) in four different scales of environment proved the effectiveness of our method. A paper was published on 2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).

### Why are you interested in conducting research with these faculty? Provide your interests for each faculty member you selected above.

Professor Roger Levy focuses on theoretical and applied questions in the processing of natural language, which perfectly matches my research interest. How a fixed set of knowledge and resources be deployed to manage uncertainty? This is the question appeared on the professor's personal website as well as the question that confuses me for a long time, and I want to find the answer under the guidance of Professor Levy.

While reading Professor Gary Cottrell's personal website and his lab website GURU, I find him a very nice person with passion and humor. Prof. Gary Cottrell has a wide range of research topics, and what matters to me is his research in deep learning, which could be used to solve the problem of understanding natural language. Also, I find Prof. Gary Cottrell's lab welcomes students to propose and guide their own research topics and the research interests of his students varies, which leaves me a very good impression. Because my inclination to my research interest is not so hard, I really want to get in touch with more choices so that I can finally find what I truly love.

## Statement of Purpose

Curiosity is what underpins the human instinct to explore the world. Of many hobbies I developed as a child, the one that most inspired me was the art of calligraphy. Ten years into my calligraphy practice, I appreciate that every writing style has its own aesthetics. Some styles are fast, energetic and powerful; others remain soft, slow and orderly. When I write a Tang poetry with multiple styles, I learn how to perform a perfect calligraphy work, making me the youngest to reach the highest level under the guidance of my teacher.

It was this same innate curiosity and exploration that I sought out in the calligraphy practice that I have applied to improving my technological skills. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. For example, during my first year of college I have programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore I have taken an interest in front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; and during this time, I have also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate activities in my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which cover a huge range of fields, are a record of the exploration I have made in software development, together giving me an excellent overview of the software world.

Being interested in so many various areas is a gift as well as a challenge, so I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, I found my passion for programming and my coding skills improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month after joining the company, this figure was reduced to just two iterations.

For curiosity's sake, I belong to those who frequently emerge fantastic ideas. Once when I was watching Arrow on YouTube, I felt super uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because what I imagined was that I was lying in a sofa, just like watching TV at home. I put it into reality in hackShanghai 2014, with an app on my smart phone controlling Chrome browser by an extension. This invention surprisingly won Second Prize in the hackathon, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic ideas could also have strong power.

Now, another fantastic idea is forming in my mind. When I started to write this statement, I asked a question to Siri: 'What kind of students does UCSD need?', and was surprised when only confusing and unexpected answers appeared. Perhaps there was no single right answer to this question, but it was interesting that Siri was unable to give any constructive advice. I asked myself why Artificial Intelligence had failed to do so? It made me think of a similar experience at Microsoft. Working as a member and developer in a team, whose product required high performance and stability, I received reports from the test team almost daily, complaining about how our service was slow or even completely down. I could not help but wonder what if Artificial Intelligence could reduce all these drudgeries? With a well-designed learning algorithm, accompanied by a large bank of optimization records and corresponding automation solutions, perhaps someday this dream will become reality. I want to make my own contribution to the realization of Artificial Intelligence solutions, because it is the ability of software to help people in their lives and jobs that drives my interest in Computer Science.

In the field of Artificial Intelligence, I am still a relative novice, but I look forward to becoming more experienced. As a unique skill set in very high demand, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the sub discipline I want to further study in Artificial Intelligence. UCSD has state-of-the-art NLP technology and world-class education resource, which can help me overcome the difficulties of joining halfway. To prepare myself fully for graduate study, I have made an academic plan, based on the current development of my knowledge. In the breadth requirements, I plan to consolidating my technological foundation, for example, in Algorithm Design and Analysis, Operating Systems and Machine Learning. In the depth requirements, Artificial Intelligence track is clearly my first choice, so in the available twelve units, Machine Learning Theory can explain the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning to strengthen my understanding of it; in Statistical Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Modeling, I can learn the modern approaches to NLP to improve my insufficient background in the field. In addition to four units of research in the electives, I would like to enrich my knowledge and broaden my horizons by taking Interaction Design Research, Database System Implementation and Selected Topics in Graphics.

Within the outstanding NLP researchers at UCSD, I am most interested in Professor Roger Levy's work on theoretical and applied questions in the processing of natural language, which perfectly matches my research interest. How a fixed set of knowledge and resources to be deployed to manage uncertainty? This is the question that appears on the professor's personal website as well as the question that has confused me for a long time, and I want to ascertain the answer under the guidance of Professor Roger Levy.

After graduation, I want to put what I gain at UCSD into the industry, turning cutting-edge NLP technologies into pragmatic products. If possible, I look forward to positioning myself as a researcher at Google. At the awards ceremony of the Google Excellence Scholarship 2015, I was completely fascinated by work shard about how to use the world's largest data set to do cool things, like predicting a movie's box-office revenue, which had become very common in this company. Google also holds the best translation system in the world, and in areas such as these I can utilize my talents in NLP while also fulfilling the dream of making a better Artificial Intelligence.

San Diego is a very beautiful harbor city with mild year-round climate and extensive beaches. My girl-friend Sherry Shi is also going to apply for UCSD in the major of accounting. I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at UCSD and I believe that it is the place where I can realize my full potential.
