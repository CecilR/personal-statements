# PS 2.0 About My Plan

To prepare for the future work, I decide to devote myself into Opensource Community and try to do some great work to gain some fame in some engineering fields when I have time and energy in my graduate school. Another way is to be the contributor of some famous project. These two ways are not so easy for me, but if I can achieve the goal, I will be very competitive when I try to find a job in an IT company.

After I graduae from the graduate school, I want to be an employee of a big IT company, like Facebook, Google and Amazon. There are plenty of reasons for me to work there, such as learning the front edge of technology, studying the formal software building system and enjoying their considerate welfare. However, the factor plays the key role in this decision is the chance I can talk to many great people. The promotion of self hard work is always limited, but people will get fast growth with the combination of their hard work and the advice from some experience people. These companies never lacks great people and I can make use of such huge resource to improve myself in the initial stage of my career path.

After two or three years working a big IT company, I want to come back to China. First, I will seek for some opportunities to transfer back in my company. If this opportunity is impossible, I will try to find a job in a company in China like those company mentioned above. With the accumelation in America, I think I do have some skills to make some excellent products that can prove my ability and potential. I want to use these skills to prove my value in the company and get promoted to see some higher level of building a software.

My career still have many exceptions. I may go to some startups as a technic leader if I have a chances. This is really another challenge for me to be a technic leader because I should be responsible for what I choose, what I decide and what I abandoned. Things I care about is never a function or a class, but a whole product. Most importantly, I must try my best because I may encounter much more challenges than before not only from myself, but also from the team. But I'm really excited to face them and realize the value of myself.
