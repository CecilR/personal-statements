# MSBIC - Ver 10.1

## The application requires a personal essay for the application. What makes a good essay?

We are looking for strong evidence that you can do well in our degree program. For example, a description of your academic experience, your achievement in these courses project, is good evidence. A description of a software project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the project is good evidence. Please write the essay yourself. Get help of course, but it should be substantially your own words.

Prepare a Statement of Purpose. Type or print neatly a concise one- or two-page statement in this format:

* Part I: Briefly state your objective in pursuing a professional graduate degree in MSBIC. Tell us if you have a particular reason for applying to this degree.
* Part II: Describe your background in fields particularly relevant to your objective. List here any relevant academic, industrial or commercial experience.
* Part III: Include any additional information you wish to supply to the Admissions Committee.

Prepare a concise one or two page essay that describes your interest in entrepreneurship and biotechnology leadership, and why you wish to pursue this degree at Carnegie Mellon. In particular, your essay should be as specific as possible in describing your goals and should describe any relevant education, research, commercial, government, or teaching experience. If you are applying to more than one program, you may \(but are not required to\) submit a separate essay for each program. Include your name and User ID on the essay.

## Statement of Purpose

Curiosity is what underpins the human instinct to explore the world. Of many hobbies I developed as a child, the one that most inspired me was the art of calligraphy. Ten years into my calligraphy practice, I appreciate that every writing style has its own aesthetics. Some styles are fast, energetic and powerful; others remain soft, slow and orderly. When I write a Tang poetry with multiple styles, I learn how to perform a perfect calligraphy work. Under the guidance of my teacher, I was the youngest student to reach the highest level in calligraphy.

It was this same innate curiosity and exploration that I sought out in the calligraphy practice that I have applied to improving my technological skills. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. For example, during my first year of college I have programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore I have taken an interest in front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; and during this time, I have also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate activities in my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which span multiple fields, have served as a record of the exploration I have made in software development, together giving me an excellent overview of the software world.

My vast interest repertoire has been a gift, as well as a challenge. In order to entertain my intellectual recreations, I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.

Curiosity alone has fostered my development of and incursion into setting foot in new fields. I took an interest in MSBIC program when I read what John Vu, the Program Director, posed on his website: 'I'm not certain what the next big thing will be but I believe it to be located somewhere at the intersection of computer science, biosciences and healthcare.' In addition to the strong relationship between modern gene technology and information technology, I focus more on the opportunities from the combination of healthcare and computer science. At Microsoft, despite being the driving force in the team, I insisted on going to the gym every day to seek for work-life balance. Educated by and benefited from a professional fitness coach, I found that many colleagues lacked awareness and methods of fitness, which had already been a common problem for modern commuters. With the cutting-edge sensor technology, collecting health information becomes more and more convenient, but following my experience in using fitness apps and intelligent wearable equipment, how to adequately utilize these huge data still remains a problem.

In my graduate study, I would like to create the platform, offering more effective and professional fitness suggestion, as my capstone project at MSBIC. In such platform, some specific health data requires experts to analyze profitably, while other situation needs to be solved by large data solutions. I believe that finding inner connection between health data and customized suggestion is the key. With the collection of health data and its corresponding suggestion, the supervised Machine Learning algorithm behind the platform will be powerful enough to handle different situations. My graduate academic goal is to find out a well-designed learning algorithm qualified to support analyzing a large amount of personal health data and giving fitness suggestion precisely.

After obtaining the Master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon, I would like to start my own business, extending my capstone project into a marketable product. In addition to its original functionality, pushing notification for daily fitness plan and dieting suggestions, standardizing fitness gestures by camera and early warning of disease will make the platform more popular and useful. As a potential business plan, the platform also has plenty of profit opportunities: platform will make money from providing users with valuable fitness plan; huge real health data will be helpful to new drug development, which prove to have a large market need; the platform effect will attract offline gyms to promote their brand recognition. I want to build up the product’s image of including every respect related to healthcare, and maybe someday, it can integrate disparate biotechnology innovation into a broader system, leading to more effective healthcare solutions.

The special MSBIC curriculum setting will be a huge boost to me in realizing my career goal. With core courses, I can experience a full process of putting an idea into reality, from identifying an emerging trend to generating a formal business plan and software product beta, to help me develop the platform step by step. Besides, course like Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures that has already proved valuable in overall technology improvement, Fundamentals of Biotechnology and Computational Methods for Biological Modeling and Simulation, will be very conducive to me, who is ready to plunge myself into biotechnologies. Software Methods in Biotechnology and Life Science and Automation of Biological Research directly will enrich my knowledge and enhance my skills in finding the inner link between health data and fitness suggestions through large data mining. In other knowledge courses, Big Data Systems in Practice will broaden and strengthen my understanding of fundamentals methods dealing with Big Data; Mathematical Foundations for Data Science will teach me the underlying theory that supports the blooming data science technology.

The tacit combination of academy and industry is another great advantage. I can learn much practical experience from those outstanding instructors with strong backgrounds in both research and engineering. The bridge between theoretical knowledge and applied engineering is what most of other Master's Program failed to offer, but nonetheless the urgent and lacking part for students. Through the special core curriculum in the program, industry advisors will also provide me with some key insights into how business operate, helping me transform my fitness platform into an effective business solution.

I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at CMU and feel confident that MSBIC is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential.
