# PS 8.3 UCLA

'Come on, guys, see what we have made!' a shout broke the peace in the classroom, where almost all the students in the first pilot class in scientific and technological innovation in Shanghai were busy getting the last preparation for the China Adolescents Science & Technology Innovation Contest (CASTIC). The shout was given by my partner and we have just finished the final round of test for our system which recognized human gestures to play simple games. My classmates gathered around our working table, rushing to try 'Doodle Jump' in front of the camera, while I, as the creator of this software, sat on the side and witnessed my work bringing happiness to people, with pleasure and sense of accomplishment.

This happened in 2011 when I first came to know how exactly a program was created and what they brought us. After four years of professional training, the boy, who indulged in codes day and night then, became ambitious and skilled, but his thirst for knowledge and interests in programming didn't change. I love recruiting like-minded friends and bringing ideas into reality through technological methods. In my third year of college, I took part in hackShanghai, a feast for the programmers from top universities in China. As a leader of a four-member team, I did not sleep for the whole night, working continuously for 36 hours to get our projects done. Though tired to barely stand in the end, I enjoyed every moment in the process. I can hardly believe myself when I heard my team get the second prize out of 60 excellent teams. Since that moment, programming changed from being more than a hobby to me, but a faith to struggle for life.

My short-term goal is becoming an engineer specializing in website performance optimization. I came to notice the concept of performance in an occasional chance when I took part in a contest aiming to develop a fast online answering system. In the first round of check, my website is much slower than the first one. Out of curiosity as well as emulation, I tried locating the places which cost time longer than normal to uncover those reasons. By careful observation and analysis, I found that congestion mainly happened in fetching user's problem list. To replace the heavy database access operation, I designed a function that generated the list in O(1)'s time based on hash, since I noticed that the relationship between users and problems was analogous to that between input and output of a hash function. Moreover, to further lower the number of database access, I stored frequently accessed data, like past time and access token, in the memory instead of database by using Memcached service. Performance optimization was a gradual and lengthy process, but I was deeply fascinated by watching every improvement I have made contributed to my ranking. I gained extremely large hands-on experience of performance optimization and germinated the idea to be a specialist in this field in the future.

What motivated me to delve deep and go further was the new ideas about performance inspired by the audacious and innovative methods I learnt in research. I entered the lab sponsored by Associate Professor Ni whose research focus was in swarm intelligence and led a group to explore the application of these methods on Robot Path Planning (RPP). In doing field research, I consulted a great deal of literature that broadened my horizon with variety of methods to solve time-consuming problems. For instance, ACO, an algorithm that emulated the action of ant colony, provided fresh perspective to solve discrete combinatorial optimization problems. I proposed three specific strategies to improve ACO algorithm in solving RPP and gave persuading experiment results to prove the effectiveness. By studying these methods, the future of computing, I saw big room for improvement in performance optimization, waiting me to explore.

To fulfill my short-term goal, I preferred to start my career in technology giants. On the one hand, solutions serve for requirements. A big company usually has bigger requirements for optimizing performance of their services. On the other hand, by the abundant technological and sociable resources in big companies, I can build a firm foothold in the industry field to get prepared for my long-term goal. In the internship at Microsoft, I recognized how discreet an enterprise-level application was being built. For instance, whenever I was to check in my code, I had to ask for a code review by peers. Also every release should be checked by multiple tests to record expectation of performance. The professional process fascinated me and pushed me to work harder. Within three months joining Microsoft, I contributed 30 thousands lines of code and participated in more than 100 code review discussion. My internship extended further than mere programming. I learnt to keep work-life balance and took part in such activities as foosball. I also became the only intern who joined the Visual Studio China Basketball Team.

Mentioning of what my long-term goal is, I wish to enhance the current automation of performance test system after accumulating enough experience in performance optimization. Working at Microsoft, I witnessed how a well-designed performance test system facilitated developers, such as sending real-time report automatically when abnormal performance situation occurred. However, my expectation exceeds more than that. I am intended to build more intelligent system which involves three levels: firstly, detecting the particular lines of code that cause congestion; secondly, giving constructive suggestions on how to optimize; finally, automatically improving the performance even with inefficient codes.

I dream of entering UCLA for two reasons. UCLA offers abundant education resources and has many excellent CS professors who are amazing at teaching. Courses, like Operating Systems Principles by Eggert and Algorithms in System Design/Architecture by Potkonjak, not only give huge boosts to me in understanding computer science, but underpin the foundations for job hunting as well. Besides, UCLA has a strong industry connection. Companies prefer UCLA because of its reputation for being academically rigorous and they also have a voice in curriculum planning. This means that I'll have a higher chance of getting that job from these big corporations because they know what is being taught here.

Another reason is due to VLSI Architecture, Synthesis & Technology Laboratory (VAST). The current project System Level Design Automation in VAST has a strong connection to my goal to design an enhanced performance optimization automation system. For example, I can learn a lot from the optimizer which performs system level optimizations in the project and put it into optimizing inefficient code automatically. The experience of automating performance optimization will be very conducive to my implementation to the system as well. I can imagine that, with the professional expertise developed at UCLA, I will bring my potential into full play in my future efforts to practice my dream.
