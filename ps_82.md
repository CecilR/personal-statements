'Come on, guys, see what we have made!' a shout broke the peace in the classroom, where almost all the students in the first pilot class in scientific and technological innovation in Shanghai were busy getting the last preparation for the China Adolescents Science & Technology Innovation Contest (CASTIC). The shout was given by my partner and we have just finished the final round of test for our system which can recognise human gestures to play simple games. My classmates gathered around our working table, rushing to try 'Doodle Jump' in front of the camera, while I, as the creator of this software, sat on the side and witnessed my work bringing happiness to people, with pleasure and sense of accomplishment.

This happened in 2011 when I first came to know how exactly a program was created and what they brought us. After four years of professional training, the boy, who indulged in codes day and night then, became ambitious and skilled, but his thirst for knowledge and interests in programming didn't change. I love recruiting like-minded friends and bringing ideas into reality through technological methods. In my third year of college, I took part in hackShanghai, a feast for the programmers from top universities in China. As a leader of a four-member team, I did not sleep for the whole night, working continuously for 36 hours to get our projects done. Though tired to barely stand in the end, I enjoyed every moment in the process. I can hardly believe myself when I heard my team get the second prize out of 60 excellent teams. Since that moment, programming changed from being more than a hobby to me, but a faith to struggle for life.

My short-term goal is becoming an engineer specializing in website performance optimisation in a big technology company. I came to notice the concept of performance in an occasional chance when I took part in a contest aiming to develop a fast online answering system. In the first round of check, my website is much slower than the first one. Out of curiosity as well as emulation, I tried locating the places which cost time longer than normal to uncover those reasons. By careful observation and analysis, I found that congestion mainly happened in fetching user's problem list. To replace the heavy database access operation, I designed a function that can generate the list in O(1)'s time based on hash, according to my findings that the relationship between users and problems was analogous to hash function. One user was always mapped to a constant list while one list was allowed but not recommended to correspond two users. This improvement reduced the average response time of one second, especially the first time user logged into the system, bringing my site to the first place. Moreover, to further lower the number of database access, I stored frequently accessed data, like past time and access token, in the memory instead of database by using Memcached service. I gained extremely large hands-on experience of performance optimisation and germinated the idea to be a specialist in this field in the future.

What motivated me to delve deep and go further was the new ideas about performance inspired by these audacious and innovative methods in research. I entered the lab sponsored by Associate Professor Ni whose research focus is in swarm intelligence and led a group to explore the application of these methods on Robot Path Planning (RPP). In doing field research, I consulted a great deal of literature that broadened my horizon with variety of methods to solve time-consuming problems. For instance, ACO, an algorithm that emulated the action of ant colony, provided fresh perspective to solve discrete combintorial optimization problems. I proposed three specific strategies to improve ACO algorithm in solving RPP and gave persuading experiment results to prove the effectiveness. By studying these methods, the future of computing, I saw big room for improvement in performance optimization and can't help but put what I learnt into practice.

I am willing to start my career in technology giants to build a firm foothold in the industry, on the basis of the unforgettable internship experience at Microsoft. I recognized how discreet an enterprise-level application was being built. Whenever I was to check in my code, I had to ask for a code review by peers. After consensus, the Continuous Integration System would run it with the corresponding test cases automatically. Also every release should be checked by performance testing to record expectation of certain APIs. The professional process fascinated me and pushed me to work harder. Within three months joining Microsoft, I contributed 30 thousands lines of code and participated in 100+ code reviews discussion. This opportunity strengthened my professional skills as well as teamwork consciousness. In the every other day scrum, I gave constructive advice to our products and discussed the plan with colleagues. I also cooperated with another teammate to build a management portal for our system which facilitated our partners a lot in calling our services.

At Microsoft, my internship extended further than mere programming. I learnt to keep work-life balance, such as playing foosball after lunch. I was the only intern who joined the Visual Studio China Basketball Team as well. This journey elevated me both in technological and sociable level.

I dream of entering UCLA for two reasons. UCLA offers abundant education resources and has many excellent CS professors who are amazing at teaching. Courses, like Operating Systems Principles by Eggert and Algorithms in System Design/Architecture by Potkonjak, not only give huge boosts to me in understanding computer science, but underpin the foundations for job hunting as well. Besides, UCLA has a strong industry connection. Companies prefer UCLA because of its reputation for being academically rigorous and they also have a voice in curriculum planning. This means that I'll have a higher chance of getting that job from these big corporations because they know what is being taught here. The above two points are clearly conducive to my short-term goal.

However, my career goal exceeds more than being a bolt on a big machine. Through years of experience accumulated, I want to lead a technical team in a startup company. During the internship at Microsoft, I witnessed how a well-designed performance test system facilitated developers by sending real-time report automatically when abnormal performance situation occurred. My long-term goal is to enhance the current automation of performance optimization. I am intended to build the system in three phases: firstly, detecting the particular lines of code which cause the congestions; secondly, giving constructive suggestions on how to optimise; finally, automatically improving the performance even with inefficient code.

Besides the growing responsibility, startups will provide me with larger space to exploit my talents in technology as well as a greater opportunity to turn ideas into products. Moreover, Los Angeles is becoming a new assembly point in California for startups due to the increasing land price of Silicon Valley. I can imagine that, with the international perspective and professional expertise developed at UCLA, I will bring my potential into full play in my future efforts to practice my dreams.
