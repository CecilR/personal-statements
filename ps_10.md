#PS1.0 About My Story

I am Yao Yiyun and now I dream of becoming a great programmer who can write codes to do many cool things. Grown up in the traditional Chinese education system, I was taught to beat others in the scores and believed hard work this time can make me a bright and comfortable future. Therefore I study hard before I was admitted by my senior school.

After several years of delighted schooling, I was lucky to get the admission from a school which ranks top four in Shanghai. More fortunately, I was promised to be educated in an advanced class after taking some strange but interesting tests. The class is also firstly set up in this school, and its initial purpose is to cultivate the talents for science and technology. Due to the speciality of the class, I gain the freedom which I have never imagined before and I got the chance to play with codes and computers earlier than most of other students in China.

I learnt my first programming language Visual Basic in an interest group. VB is a practical language, especially in write GUI under Windows. It is also very easy to learn and master, and my interests was fully inspired. However, as we all know, VB is not powerful enough, and because of the following requirements, I began to get in touch with C and C++. The class I stayed in provides me the freedom, and also I have to take part in a famous competition in the teenagers innovative fields to get a high prize as a duty.

To prepare for the competition, I selected a project and tried to solve the main problem by writing some codes with the help of the graduates in College of Software Engineering in SJTU. Thanks to their great help, I spent three month in staying SJTU with my partner to write our first formal project and eventually gained the first prize in the competition. To me, the result is no longer the most important part, the free environment of CSE have left me a deep impression, where I can write codes to do what I want and learn the cool skills make cool things cooler. I never feel so happy and full of sense of accomplishement, so I decided to stay in this college and learn more about coding if I was given a chance.

However, the fact doesn't go with my willings. I lose my patience and interests in learning Chinese and English, so unfortunately I failed in my College Entrance Exam and go to another university, SEU, which locates in Nanjing. Because my interests in coding, I gave up the chance to enter better colleges in SEU, and admitted to the CSE. After a short period of tough time, I articulated what is valuable to me and what is no longer necessary, then I made my decision to be a programmer. From my first day in college, I tried my best to make myself closer to my dream, doing projects and practicing my skills, and I feel excited when I am getting more and more closer to my dream. With my interests and hard work, I got a great promotion in my programming skills and learnt a lot of new technics, such as buiding a website, writing an app and creating a service. Another thing I didn't expected is that I scored first in my college. I really think it is for the benefits of interests because I never feel I was learning something difficult, but doing my favorites. Now my concept has changed, hard work and great efforts may take you to the first place, while doing what you really want to do can make you excellent in this area.
