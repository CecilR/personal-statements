## Statement of PurposeCuriosity is what underpins the human instinct to explore the world. Of many hobbies I developed as a child, the one that most inspired me was the art of calligraphy. Ten years into my calligraphy practice, I appreciate that every writing style has its own aesthetics. Some styles are fast, energetic and powerful; others remain soft, slow and orderly. When I write a Tang poetry with multiple styles, I learn how to perform a perfect calligraphy work. Under the guidance of my teacher, I was the youngest student to reach the highest level in calligraphy.It was this same innate curiosity and exploration that I sought out in the calligraphy practice that I have applied to improving my technological skills. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. For example, during my first year of college I have programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore I have taken an interest in front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; and during this time, I have also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate activities in my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which span multiple fields, have served as a record of the exploration I have made in software development, together giving me an excellent overview of the software world.My vast interest repertoire has been a gift, as well as a challenge. In order to entertain my intellectual recreations, I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.Curiosity alone has fostered my development of and incursion into setting foot in new fields. I took an interest in MSBIC program when I read what the director of department, John Vu, posed on his website: 'I'm not certain what the next big thing will be but I believe it to be located somewhere at the intersection of computer science, biosciences and healthcare.' In addition to the strong relationship between modern gene technology and information technology, I focus more on the opportunities from the combination of healthcare and computer science. At Microsoft, despite being the driving force in the team, I insisted on going to the gym every day to seek for work-life balance. Educated by and benefited from a professional fitness coach, I found that many colleagues lacked awareness and methods of fitness, which has already been a common problem for modern commuters. With the modern sensor technology, collecting health information becomes more and more convenient, but following my experience in using fitness apps and intelligent wearable equipment, how to adequately utilize these huge data still remains a problem.In my graduate study, I would like to create the platform, offering more effective and professional fitness suggestion, as my capstone project at MSBIC. In such platform, some specific health data requires experts to analyze profitably, while other situation needs to be solved by large data solutions. I believe that finding inner connection between health data and customized suggestion is the key and with the collection of health data and its corresponding suggestion, the supervised Machine Learning algorithm behind the platform will be more powerful to handle different situations. My graduate academic goal is to find out a well-designed learning algorithm qualified to support analyzing a large amount of health data collected from every user to give fitness suggestion precisely.After obtaining the Master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon, I would like to start my own business, extending my capstone project into a marketable product. In addition to its original functionality, pushing notification for daily fitness plan and dieting suggestions, standardizing fitness gestures by camera and early warning of disease will make the platform more popular and useful. As a potential business plan, the platform also has plenty of profit opportunities: platform will make money from providing users with valuable fitness plan; huge real health data will be helpful to new drug development, which prove to have a large market need; the platform effect will attract offline gyms to promote brand recognition. I want to build up the product’s image of including every respect related to healthcare, and maybe someday, it can integrate disparate biotechnology innovation into a broader system, leading to more effective healthcare solutions.The special MSBIC curriculum setting will be a huge boost to me in realizing my career goal. Within the core courses, I can experience a full process of putting an idea into reality, from identifying an emerging trend to developing a formal business plan and software product beta, to help me develop the platform step by step. Besides, course like Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures that has already proved valuable in overall technology improvement, Fundamentals of Biotechnology and Computational Methods for Biological Modeling and Simulation, will be very conducive to me, who is ready to plunge myself into biotechnologies. Software Methods in Biotechnology and Life Science and Automation of Biological Research directly will enrich my knowledge and enhance my skills in finding the inner link between health data and fitness suggestions through large data mining. In other knowledge courses, Big Data Systems in Practice will broaden and strengthen my understanding of fundamentals methods dealing with Big Data; Mathematical Foundations for Data Science will teach me the underlying theory that supports the blooming data science technology.The tacit combination of academy and industry is another great advantage. I can learn much practical experience from those outstanding instructors with strong backgrounds in both research and engineering. The bridge between theoretical knowledge and applied engineering is what most of other Master's Program failed to offer, but nonetheless the urgent and lacking part for students. Through the special core curriculum in the program, industry advisors will also provide me with some key insights into how business operate, helping me transform my fitness platform into an effective business solution.I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at CMU and feel confident that MSBIC is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential.

## Professional Experience
It was in 2014 that I first set my foot in industry. Through the experience of working in a startup company, I applied what I learnt in school into practice and germinated the idea of setting up my own business.
To meet the requirement of rapid development, I found a quick and effective way to learn programming. During my internship at the startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.
In addition to technological improvement, I learnt a lot in how to serve as a leader in a startup when working with my friend who was also the CTO of the company. I realized that being the person in charge required not only a strong ability to solve technical problems, but a precise overview and judgment of the product as well. For example, he collected over 60 competitive products and analyzed their overall situation, including technology selection, marketing strategy and its strengths and weaknesses compared to ours. The action led to an accurate delivery to the app market and warm responses from the target users. Besides, I witnessed and benefited from his wisdom of making full use of every one’s advantage. With his clear job assignment and united efforts of five developers, the first mobile game in my company had once ranked 13th of all the paid games in Apple Store.
After one year’s preparation and rounds of selection, I got the opportunity to start a new journey in a company with totally different style. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was to publish documents from a git repository, relying heavily on GitHub service. Thanks to my acquaintance with it, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.
At Microsoft, there were plenty of experienced engineers who were willing to share their opinions and in such environment I developed the ability to see the root of a problem and figure out the most direct way to solve it. For example, I encountered a problem when I was using a third-party library to build a command-line program. Through contacting with several other team leaders, I opened an issue to report the situation directly to its author, expressed my real expectation to the library, and received very clear responses. The author also kindly provided me with a workaround, saving at least 3 hours trawling through the documentation.
Despite my personal extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering play in helping the huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of Computer Science technology. I believe that the familiarity with open-source technology will be a huge boost to my graduate study at Carnegie Mellon.
With these professional experiences in hand, I feel confident that I get prepared for my graduate study in MSBIC program. The practice in the startup cultivates my innovation in thinking and perseverance in facing difficulties; while the technology giants experience hones my ability in critical thinking and finding solutions. They both give me confidence and faith to be a good leader in a software project, or even an integral business plan, which guarantees my performance in the core curriculum of MSBIC.
I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at CMU and feel confident that MSBIC is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential.
