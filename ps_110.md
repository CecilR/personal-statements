## Questions in application

### What are your research interests?

My research interest is in Artificial Intelligence, which specialize in Natural Language Processing. I haven't got much related experience, but I am quite interested in this field because I want to make the current Artificial Intelligence, like Siri and Cortana, more humanize and smart.

### What is your research experience (including publications)?

I entered Associate Professor Qingjian Ni's lab in my freshman year at Southeast University. In my second year of college, I led a research group, applying Ant Colony Optimization to Robot Path Planning. We proposed a novel heterogeneous ACO algorithm to improve ACO's quality of solutions and performance in solving such problems. In the algorithm, we used two ant colony with different sensitivity to the pheromone and path selection strategy and controlled their colony size by the stagnant rate of the searching situation in order to avoid premature convergence. The experiment result of 5 comparative algorithms in 4 different-scale environment proved the effectiveness of our method. A paper was published on 2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).

### Why are you interested in conducting research with these faculty? Provide your interests for each faculty member you selected above.

While reading Professor Gary Cottrell's personal website and his lab website GURU, I find him a very nice person with passion and humor. Prof. Gary Cottrell has a wide range of research topics, and what matters to me is his research in deep learning, which could be used to solve the problem of understanding natural language. Also, I find Prof. Gary Cottrell's lab welcomes students to propose and guide their own research topics and the research interests of his students varies, which leaves me a very good impression. Because my inclination to my research interest is not so hard, I really want to get in touch with more choices so that I can finally find what I truly love.

Professor Roger Levy focuses on theoretical and applied questions in the processing of natural language, which perfectly matches my research interest. How a fixed set of knowledge and resources be deployed to manage uncertainty?  This is the question appeared on the professor's personal website as well as the question that confuses me for a long time, and I want to find the answer under the guidance of Professor Roger Levy.

## Statement of Purpose

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join GitHub, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt most of the things I need to become a qualified software engineer from this community.

The GitHub community provided me with a quick and effective way to learn. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gain confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, my programming ability has improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month of joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

I also tasted the happiness of collaboration in team projects through working with teammates on GitHub. Once when I took the lead to developed a large live platform, because of my teammates' unfamiliarity to GitHub, in the early stages of development, they felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. With my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks. Our project won the First Prize in the competition, but what made me more excited is that for the first time my partners and I achieved such good cooperation.

After two years' consistent effort on GitHub, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has influenced me deeply in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. While academic research is still a relatively closed field, things are starting to change. There is a growing trend towards opening the source of the experiments among researchers, offering convincing proof for their published papers. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods is appearing on GitHub, popularizing abstruse knowledge, as with A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python. When I started to do research on Ant Colony Optimization, an open-source implementation gave me a big help in programming the framework, and afterwards, to make my own contribution, I also put the improved algorithm in a public repository, hoping that maybe someday, the simple gesture will be of benefit to those in need.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team whose product was an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, relying heavily on the GitHub site. Thanks to my acquaintance with the community, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering played in helping this huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of computer science technology.

With these experiences in hand, my career ambition is to become a researcher in a major technology company, contributing code to exciting open-source projects as well as putting it into profitable production. I heard the position on an open-source community session, a researcher from Huawei shared his work of how to apply Spark to huge data processing in practice. I was completely fascinated by his speech because that was exactly what I would like to do, a bridge between my interest and job.

In my graduate study, I therefore plan to be a contributor of some famous projects to practice skills and gather experience for my career. Following my interview experience at Microsoft, these huge companies warmly welcome star programmers or those who have a voice in any specific areas. But this goal is not going to be easy, because being a contributor of an open-source project requires a deep understanding of its design philosophy as well as professional expertise in Computer Science, including programming, engineering, and even coding styles.

The comprehensive course offered by the Master's program in UCSD will be a huge boost to me. As far as I know, the practical hardcore courses like Computer Networks, Compilers and Operating Systems all consist of paper-reading and course projects, and I believe my research experience guarantees my performance in these courses; similarly, in the theoretical course, such as Algorithms, Machine Learning and Functional Programming, there are heavy-payload homework, which will be a great challenge as well as a rare opportunity to become better under high pressure.

The program also provides me with abundant opportunities in research. Among all the professors, I am most interested in Professor Gary Cottrell. Besides his research in deep learning that parallels mine, I find his lab, Garyâ€™s Unbelievable Research Unit, welcomes students to propose and guide their own research topic and the research interests of his students vary hugely, which leaves me a very good impression. Because my inclination to a specific research interest is not so hard, I really want to get in touch with more choices so that I can finally find what I truly love.

San Diego is a very beautiful harbor city with mild year-round climate and extensive beaches. I look forward to further my study in this city and I believe that UCSD is the place where I can realize my full potential though my future efforts.
