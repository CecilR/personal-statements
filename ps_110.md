## Questions in application

### What are your research interests?

My research interests is in Artificial Intelligence, which specialize in Natural Language Processing. I haven't got much related experience, but I am quite interested in this field because I want to make the current Artificial Intelligence, like Siri and Cortana, more humanize and smart.

### What is your research experience (including publications)?

I entered Associate Professor Qingjian Ni's lab in my freshman year at Southeast University. In my second year of college, I led a research group, applying Ant Colony Optimization to Robot Path Planning. We proposed a novel hetereogeneous ACO algorithm to improve ACO's quality of solutions and performance in solving such problems. In the algorithm, we used two ant colony with different sensitivity to the pheromone and path selection strategy and controlled their colony size by the stagnant rate of the searching situation in order to avoid premature convergence. The experiement result of 5 comparative algorithms in 4 different-scale environment proved the effectiveness of our method. A paper was published on 2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).

### Why are you interested in conducting research with these faculty? Provide your interests for each faculty member you selected above.

While reading Professor Gary Cottrell's personal website and his lab website GURU, I find him a very nice person with passion and humor. Prof. Gary Cottrell has a wide range of research topics, and what matters to me is his research in deep learning, which could be used to solve the problem of understanding natural language. Also, I found Prof. Gary Cottrell's lab welcomes students to propose and guide their own research topics and the research interest of his students varies, which leaves me a very good impression. Because my inclination to my research interests is not so hard, I really want to get in touch with more choices so that I can finally find what I truly love. 

Professor Roger Levy focuses on theoretical and applied questions in the processing of natural language, which perfectly matches my research interest. How a fixed set of knowledge and resources be deployed to manage uncertainty?  This is the question appeared on the professor's personal website as well as the question that canonfuses me for a long time, and I want to find the answer under the guidance of Professor Roger Levy.

## Statement of Purpose

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join Github, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt most of the things I need to become a qualified software engineer from this community. 

The Github community provided me with a quick and effective way to learn. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on Github and other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gain confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, my programming ability has improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month of joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

I also tasted the happiness of collaboration in team projects through working with teammates on Github. Once when I took the lead to developed a large live platform, because of my teammates' unfamiliarity to Github, in the early stages of development, they felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. With my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks. Our project won the First Prize in the competition, but what made me more excited is that for the first time my partners and I achieved such good cooperation.

After two years' consistent effort on Github, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has influenced me deeply in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. While academic research is still a relatively closed field, but things are starting to change. There is a growing trend towards opening the source of  the experiments among researchers, offering convincing proof for their published papers. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods is appearing on Github, popularizing abstruse knowledge, as with A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python. When I started to do research on Ant Colony Opitmization, an open-source implementation gave me a big help in programming the framework, and afterwards, to make my own contribution, I also put my improved algorithm in a public repository. Maybe someday, the simple gesture will be of benefit to those in need.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team whose product was an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, relying heavily on the Github site. Thanks to my acquaintance with the community, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with Github, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering played in helping this huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle bring decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of computer science technology.

With these experiences in hand, my career ambition is to become a researcher in a major technology company, contributing code to exciting open-source projects as well as putting it into profitable production. I heard the position on an open-source community session held in Nanjing, when a researcher from Huawei shared his work of how to apply Spark to huge data processing in practice, and I was completely fascinated because that was the work I have been looking for, a bridge between my interest and job.

In my graduate study, I therefore plan to be a contributor of some famous projects to practice skills and gather experience for my career. But this goal is not going to be easy, because being a contributor of an open-source project requires a high ability of programming and a deep understanding of engineering. The Master's program in UCSD will be a huge boost to me in that way.



Under the tide of Big Data, I intend to be the driver behind it, specializing in such projects as scikit-learn, which provides implementation in machine learning, warmly discussed by the industry. The cutting-edge curriculum setting is a huge boost for me to overcome the difficulties of joining halfway. Beside the essential courses, such as Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures that has already proved valuable in overall technology improvement, courses like Mathematical Foundations for Data Science and Big Data Systems in Practice, will be very conducive to me, who is ready to plunge myself into data science and technologies. Companied with plenty of customized credits and loose course selection limits, I can make a good use of the abundant education resources in the School of Computer Science to hone my abilities, getting prepared for the challenges met in the career.

The tacit combination of academy and industry is another great advantage to employment. I can learn much practical experience from those outstanding instructors with strong backgrounds in both research and engineering. The bridge between theoretical knowledge and applied engineering is what most of other Master's Program failed to offer, but nonetheless the urgent and lacking part for students who aim to find their positions in firms. Through the special core curriculum set in the program, industry advisors will also provide me with some key insights into how business operate, helping me integrate emerging technologies into effective business solutions. I feel confident that MSBIC is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential through my future efforts.
