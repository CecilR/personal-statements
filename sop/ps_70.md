# MCDS - Ver 7.0

## The application requires a personal essay. What makes a good essay?

We are looking for strong evidence that you can do well in our degree program. For example, a description of your research project experience, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. A description of a large software project, your involvement in the project and the impact of the project is good evidence. A historical essay that starts with your first use of computers at age five is not good evidence. Please write the essay yourself. Get help of course, but it should be substantially your own words.

## Content

If someone asked me who I am within one word, I would use the word practitioner. For some reasons of my characteristics, I would prefer to try and see something with my own eyes. That's also why I choose Computer Science major which focuses much on putting the theory into practices. This article is also for the same purpose, I want to materialize my understanding on computer science and this program to convince you that I am qualified to be one of this program.

I have a personal [blog](http://yyypasserby.github.io/) called 'LearnByPractice' and this name also reflects my pragmatic way to learn CS, learning by practicing. When I was a freshman, I took part in a contest which aimed to build an online testing service for the students. I have never built any websites before and what lay in front of me are only some words and phrases, like 'html', 'php' and so on. I gradually search about the information of these words, starting with 'What is it?', and then 'Why we need it?' to 'How to use it?'. With some helps and tutorials on the internet and thanks to the search engine, I start to construct my first website. The process is tough because every step is unknown. When I move forward a little step, I can find a large hole and plenty of technics and terminologies occur to me. But pain and gain always come together. I learn a lot during buiding this site, and there was new ideas emerging almost everyday. Finally, this site was rewarded the second price of the contest and the prize for the site with best performance for I used Memcached service in several places to make less calls to the database.

A very successful start gave me great confidence in learning computer science, especially working with some services or systems to let everyone use and facilitate people's life and work. So during the short term of the junior, I set up a team with other five students to build an online broadcasting system based on web like twitch. The process was great, I taught them how to use git to manage source code, and how to seperate environment for development and production. The system helped us to win the fourth prize among 23 teams. However, this didn't make me so happy for our system was unable to work in production because it can only withstand 10 people online broadcasting or less due to some technical problems.

At that time, I started to think about one question: What can make a large system stable and high-performance? I have search several solutions and tried with some small-scale experiments. But still there was no such a practical environment to verify my ideas. Where can I find such environment?

The first answer came to me is Big IT Companies. With some efforts dealing with data structures and algorthms, I managed to become an intern in Microsoft. Fortunately, I was allocated to a newly-set-up team whose project is to build a new document-publishing system to replace the old one with simple and direct operations for user. In the first two months, I was assigned to a job to build a management portal based on front end for our partners to configure their document repositories. The job has been done quickly and successfully and then I started to ask for work actively. Hard work pays off. Finally, I was able to do some work related to our core system which may deals with thousands of queries per second. \(BALABALA\)

With this successful practice, my horizon is broadened. More and more questions come into my mind. What else can we do to improve the response time? What startegy can we use to deal with the different situation\(high qps and common qps\)? I know there are some mature solutions in the industry to deal with big data like hadoop and some virtual resource mechanism to maximize the usage of the hardware like openstack, but I have my own opinion on improving performance.

During my graduate, I want to build a general framework to automatically analyze and predict the user actions based on the queries and caching the predicted one to improve the performance. Currently it is not so easy for me because it is related to too many areas of knowledge that I have never touched. Learning by practicing is great but it takes time evolving from the first solution to the best practice. I think the curriculum of the system major of MCDS can help me accelerating this process and lay a solid foundation. Especially courses like Parallel Computer Architecture & Programming, Distributed Systems and Storage Systems can give me chances to learn, practice and see the best solution currently in the industry and its developing trend.

After my graduation, I also want to do the related work in big IT companies. I know Google has some related work and its may also has the requirements. Great websites with large throughput like facebook and twitter may also have the same requirements. Applying what I have done to their current system is the best, however, putting what I learnt in MCDS and my project into the production also works fine for me.

Back to this admission, what I can bring to this program is my personal innovative ideas in this direction and my pursue to build a more stable and high-performance system, and I will try to prove it in my way, learning by practicing. Just like an old saying goes in China, hard work pays off, I believe my related experience, strong background and personal opinion can make me a competitive candidate for my dream program.

## Self-QCS:

C:可以看出作者是一个非常喜爱CS的人，也是一个很坚持的人。从一开始通过边学边做慢慢构建自己的网站，到之后可以带领团队取得胜利。并且作者还非常有自己的想法，对自己喜爱领域的一些practice有自己的观点。作者的动手能力也很强，能够在公司现有的系统上快速上手，快速贡献代码，帮助团队完成目标。还能看到作者是一个有思路的人，不仅在实际的工作解决问题上，更是在自己的人生轨迹上，作者会想方设法做自己想做的事，比如像到达公司里面进行实习来尝试验证自己的想法，对自己的未来也有一定的规划。但是美中不足的是，作者没有谈及自己对于自己想法的实验的具体细节，而且和项目相关性的科研经历也很少，并且作者的经历虽然丰富但是最后的impact都不是很大，无法看出作者的实力到底如何，只能看出他做了很多事情。

Q:作者能否在详细介绍一下对于当前你想做的方向，有过哪些别的努力？

S:整体的逻辑结构比较牵强，比如，在项目过程中，扮演的角色，是什么帮助团队获得最后的胜利，可以具体说下，不然感觉作者自我的impact有限。
