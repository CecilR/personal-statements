# Recommendation Letter from My Advisor

To whom it may concern:

I am pleased to recommend Mr.Yiyun Yao who is one of the best students in my lab   to enroll in your department and lab for further study.

I am an associate professor in Southeast University, and my research is in  comptational intelligency and its applications. Mr.Yao is mainly doing the research work related to Ant Colony Optimization and its applications.

Mr.Yao entered my lab in his freshman who was the earliest in the undergraduates. As his class teacher, after the first class meeting, he came to inquiry about the information of my lab. His initiative and clear target left me a deep impression.

Because of his programming skills learnt in his high school, I asked Mr.Yao to attend as an assistant in a research group which lead by two fellow students and  try to help implement some classical algorithms. This project in the very beginning was to discuss the probability to apply ACO method or its variations to solving the Robot Path Planning problem. He learnt quickly and gave some preliminary results of the experiments to show the feasibility which help this project elevated from the college grade to national grade of Innovation Traning Program.

Mr.Yao is very determined and capable. He continued the research of this area almost individually after two fellow students left the group. Considering the taxing study workload in sophomore, he persevered in doing experiments and synced with me whenever he have found something new. He also participated in the discussison group held twice a month and gave a talk about some innovative methods in papers he have recently read. In the contrast experiments he designed, he need to implement five algorithms in four scales of environments, including three of them which required parameter adjustment. It is not easy for an undergraduate but he finished it accurately and the experiment successfully showed the feasibilty and advantages of the improved algorithms. He concluded his work into a paper with my help and publish it on CEC 2015 as the first writer.

In the contact with Mr.Yao, I found him an innovative and strong-minded man. During the project, I can found some shining point that even I did not expected to improve the algorithms in the conversation with him. In the discussion of design of the modified ACO, he gave me a list of innovative stategies which he think effective though some of them are unrealistic.

After working with this prospective young student for three years, I esteem Mr. Yao as one of the best students who have worked in my lab. For his ability in programming, potential in researching and innovation in thinking, he can be an ideal student for your program.

I recommend Mr.Yiyun Yao with no reservation.
