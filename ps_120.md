# PS 12.0 MCDS

## The application requires a personal essay. What makes a good essay?

We are looking for strong evidence that you can do well in our degree program. For example, a description of your research project experience, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. A description of a large software project, your involvement in the project and the impact of the project is good evidence. A historical essay that starts with your first use of computers at age five is not good evidence. Please write the essay yourself. Get help of course, but it should be substantially your own words.

## Content

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join GitHub, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt most of the things I need to become a qualified software engineer from the community.

In the community, I developed a quick and effective way to learn programming. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, I found the passion of programming and my coding skills have improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month after joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

I love the community because I tasted the happiness of collaboration through working on it. Once when I took the lead to developed a large live platform, because of my teammates' unfamiliarity to GitHub, in initial stage of development, they felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. With my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks. Our project won the First Prize in the competition, but what made me more excited was that for the first time my partners and I have achieved such good cooperation.

After two years' consistent effort on GitHub, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has a significant impact on me in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. For example, when I started to do research about Swarm Intelligence, a repository on GitHub, Python-Ant-Colony-TSP-Solver, gave me a big help in programming the framework, and afterwards, I also put the improved algorithm in a public repository, hoping that maybe someday, the simple similar gesture would be of benefit to those in need.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was to publish documents from a git repository, relying heavily on GitHub service. Thanks to my acquaintance with it, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering played in helping the huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of computer science technology.

In my graduate study, as data technology is gradually becoming a unique skill in very high demand, I therefore plan to be a contributor of some famous projects closely related to data science, like scikit-learn, which is warmly discussed by the industry. The cutting-edge curriculum setting in MCDS is a huge boost for me to overcome the difficulties of joining halfway. I look forward to consolidating my foundation of data science, for example, in Machine Learning; similarly, as more companies move toward large data solutions, Design and Engineering of Intelligent Info Systems should also proved valuable to me. Companied with plenty of customized credits and loose course selection limits, I can make a good use of the abundant education resources in the School of Computer Science to hone my abilities, getting prepared for the challenges met in the career. I feel confident that MCDS is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential through my future efforts.
