Front-end is a rapidly evolving field based on the blossom of Web and Internet. Javascript, as the kernel language of front-end technology, has been the most popular language for its third year on Github, which is the biggest Open Source community. This fact is enough to reflect how hot front-end currently is, so I can't help but think how it will develop in the future.

To get prepared, I focused on developing my programming skills by working hard in class. I got 18 As out of 19 professional class, especially 98 in my favorite class, Principles of Compiler. This class was amazing for its close connection between theory and practice. I selected the highest level in the course project, which is to develop a Lex, a program to judge whether a string is matched by a given regular expression (RE). But my motivation to choose this project extends further than basic implementation of the algorithm. To help the novice better understand the conversion from RE to minimal deterministic finite automation (min-DFA), I programmed to generate the diagraph of non-deterministic finite automation, deterministic finite automation and min-DFA as well as built a [website](http://compiler-lab.herokuapp.com/lex/) to demonstrate my work. I got full score in the course project by this work, but more importantly, I received several thanks from those who have trouble in learning this course and benefited from this website. This experience strongly strengthen my faith to become a software engineer who use technologies to help people.
