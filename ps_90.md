# PS 9.0

I clearly remember the situation when I first took part in a software development contest. It was the first summer vocation in college. I set up a team with other two classmates. Since we all lived in different places, we failed to find a way to share our work. Therefore, a project required 3 people's joint effort became three individual projects. Everyone wanted his/her production to represent the all, but no one actually can. The project hastily concluded in the end.

That failure shocked me, and pushed me to think about what should be responsible for it. I was born in a lonely time. I had no playmates in my childhood. Since I first received education, I was told to protect what 'belongs to' me. I read lonely books, learnt lonely knowledge and played lonely games. After 12 years, when I came to the college, I didn't have a real chance to cooperate with others. 

As a typical engineering student, I directly came up to the idea of solving it in a technological way. In my next team project, which is much larger than the former one, I began to use git to collaborate with other teammates. At first, they feel so reluctant to this tool, even thought it will slow down the developing process, but under my serious urge and patient instruction, they started to embrace it gradually and willingly. I felt quite satisfied that for the first time my partners and I had a so tacit cooperation. With the high-efficiency cooperative mode, we managed to programmed 30 thousands lines of code in 2 weeks, making our projects won the first prize.

I found a bigger meaning of share on Jul.15th 2013. On that common day, I joined Github community, which is the biggest worldwide open-source community. Since then, I have spent more than 30% of my time on it, enjoying its profits and convenience. When I required a tool to help me simplify the work, I first searched on Github to see whether there has already existed one to meet my demands. When I want to learn some skills to put my ideas into practice, I can read the well-designed tutorial for novice and try it with just a click on 'fork' button.

This community provides me with an effective way to learn Computer Science. During my internship in a startup company, I contributed my code by opening pull requests to their code repositories hosted on Github. Other developers left comments to help improve the quality of my code. After 2 weeks' collaboration, I began to comment on other people's code. Through this unique way of teaching and learning bi-directly, my programming ability has been a huge upgrade. 

I like asking questions, so I think that is why I love this community so much. In this open-source community, programming becomes not only a way to build software, but also a language for programmers to communicate their thoughts effectively. I encountered a problem when I was using a library to build a command-line tool during my internship at Microsoft. I found this project on Github and directly open an issue to ask its author. After a hot discussion with him, I got a satisfied response in one hour, saving at least 3 hours of time reading and understanding the lengthy documentation.

The spirits of Open Source also benefits in research. Academic research is still a relatively close field in Computer Science but things are starting to change. There is a growing trend for researchers to open-source their experiment data on Github, making their achievements more convincing. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods appeared, such as A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python, popularizing these abstruse knowledge. During my research, I also putting my implementation of algorithms on Github, maybe someday, this simple action can help those in need.

The same change happened gradually in big technology companies. At Microsoft, I work as a developer in Open Publishing Team (you could find this organization on Github, and I am the member of it) in MSDN China. Our product is an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, which strongly depends on Github service. On account of my acquaintance with open-source technology, I soon became the main force of the team. During my six monthsâ€™ internship, I was involved in every corner of the projects related to the interaction of Github. The huge amount of work didn't not beat me down, however, I gain much energy in doing what I love.

Influence by the spirits of Open Source, I wished to become an independent developer in an open-source community, who is able to maintain a famous project which benefits thousands of programmers. But that still can't be my occupation. My ideal career is to become a researcher in a big IT company, contributing my codes to the phenomenal open-source projects as well as putting these projects into real production to make profits for the company. I learn about this position in a session held by an open-source community in China. The developer from Huawei, who specialized in applying Spark to the problem of huge data processing, shared what they were doing and how they work in usual time. I was fully fascinated by their expression then. After so many experiences accumulated, I finally figured out where I belong and I believe I will never regret for this decision.
