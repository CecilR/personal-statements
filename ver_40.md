# PS4.0 About internship in G1Game

This is my forth semester in my college. The past year is a lucky year for me, I have finished learning most of my professional courses in Software Engineering and fortunately I have done well in those test. One month before the vacation, I make a decision to try to find a internship.

There are two main reason for me to make that decision. First and most importantly, I want to see how my skills and knowledge practiced in a real company. This problem has confused me for a very long time and I always contend that I have to know why I learn it before I learn it. At that time, I think maybe the company may give the answer to this questions, beacause in my mind, those great people in the great company may put the methods and the concepts into practice very well. The curiosity drives me to send some application on the website, like Baidu, Microsoft and etc. However, for some reasons, I wasn't given a chance to the interview. For last ten days in that months, I almost give up. However, a friend of mine suddenly call in and asked me for my resume. He said he was working for a startup as an CTO and their company needs people to do the work of transplanting their game to the Android platform. I was very surprised and excited for this unexpected chance and quickly accept it. My effort were not in vain, my resume was very matched of the requirements of the position and I had my first offer in my life.

After dealing with my test, I cannot wait to come to see how the company it is. On the onboard day, I was very excited and arrived one hours before they began to work. Nothing special on the first day, the manager told me something to obey and something to paya attention to, and my friend also the CTO tell me something about my work and after that, my work begins. My first work is to transplant the game currently debugging and running on the IOS device to the Android device. This is really a big challenge for me. As for one reason Android device is very popular in China at present, and some famous company like Xiaomi, Huawei, their system is all based on Android, so this is a very large share of the market, which means it is also a great part of business of the company; as for another, for lack of manpower, this task must be finished by myself, no teachers, no partners. The only good news is that I have some experience in development of Android and task is not so emergent.

After figuring out how the program works and where the entry is, I started to do the main work. I search a large mount of data to see if there was some experience to do this work. The preparation helps  me a lot for there are many people shared such experience and some pits in the process. But there are always things can't be solved by just searching. For instance, when I was trying to solve a file transmission problem, I found some file didn't copy on Android device and copy fluently on the IOS device. This is an abnormally phenomenon I have never seen before and I also didn't get an information on the internet either. So I try to attach the process on the phone and try to have some clues by debugging step by step. This was really a hard work for I don't know when and where the exception would come out and the debugging is single-directed, so I have to digging into every function and methods in order not to miss any possibility. After several trials, I narrowed the range into a very small one, and eventually I found it was because the function here wasn't the cross-platform one, but the standard library, but the storage file is in another place where direct access is not allowed. This experience told me that it is mostly not because your talent or your ability help you to solve the practical problem, but the patience.

With some other problems being solved, I committed a version after three weeks. In this version, the game is able to already run properly, but I can't always sync the process because everyday the feature is added to the game, many details shall be changed when transplanting to Android. So I begin to write a document whose topic is to teach a newer how to transplant our game from IOS to Android. This work changed my mind upon the document and this is the first time I have written the document so carefully that without it, all the work I have done was meaningless. And I also found writing a document is completely different from writing codes. I must state my word in the view of a greenhand, and this challenge my engineering mind. I have to find every unclear point in the logic chain, and write it from base to derived.

In the next one month, I have done two important things. First, I help to build two platform version of our game. This platform is different from IOS or Android, it is for some third-party dispatch platfrom on IOS which we treated as some beta-test for our Apple Store version and collect some bugs and reports from the real user. It really benefits our company for these platform aggregated attention from the user and also offer us a chance to improve our game to make it more attracted to user. However, we encounter some difficulties when we try to collect the bugs reported by the user, for we can't repeat the bugs just based on the description of our user, therefore I made my second contribution. I integrate a supervisor plugin into our game so that the crash report could be send to our data center when the user encountered. We just need to know the time and the userid, the state of the game can be fully recored and visualized in our supervisor website. This work greatly improved our efficiency on resolving bugs and accelerate our iteration.

After two months's intership, what I feel most is hard and full of challenge. The life in company varies a lot from the one in school. It has more emergency to deal with, you have to solve bugs reported today, not tomorrow. It also has more hardwork, some requirements is hard and fast rule, you should make it, while not solving it by replacing it with a similar one. However, working in a company can make people improve more quickly, for the real problem you must face is much larger than those you faced in school. You can use most of what you learned in school to solve practical problems and this is very cool when you finally know why you learn it. My confusion is also partly solved, but more questions come into my mind, I can't wait to find it out.
