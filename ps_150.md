# PS 15.0 UCI

## Requirement

Applicants for our graduate programs are selected using a holistic evaluation system. This essay will assist both the admissions committee and fellowship review committees to evaluate your preparation for the proposed field of study. In your statement of purpose, please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization.

A sample of topics that you might address in your statement is below. However, please structure your statement in any way that you feel best represents your research interests. Please do note that there is a 1200 word maximum for the statement.

- Academic plans and research interests
- Relevant experience
- Future career goals
- Why UC Irvine would be a good intellectual fit for you

This "Statement of Purpose" is required for all applicants and is different from the "Personal History Statement" that is also required for all applicants who are US Citizens or legal US Permanent Residents. The "Statement of Purpose" is expected to focus on your academic/research experiences and interests while the "Personal History Statement" should focus on your personal background.

In addition to the "Statement of Purpose" and "Personal History Statement", some academic programs require applicants to provide a writing sample. Applicants will be notified about any such requirements by their program and will submit any additional items separately and directly to the program. Check with your department about any such additional requirements.

## Statement of Purpose

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join GitHub, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt most of the things I need to become a qualified software engineer from this community.

The GitHub community provided me with a quick and effective way to learn. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gain confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, my programming ability has improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month of joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

I also tasted the happiness of collaboration in team projects through working with teammates on GitHub. Once when I took the lead to developed a large live platform, because of my teammates' unfamiliarity to GitHub, in the early stages of development, they felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. With my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks. Our project won the First Prize in the competition, but what made me more excited is that for the first time my partners and I achieved such good cooperation.

After two years' consistent effort on GitHub, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has influenced me deeply in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. While academic research is still a relatively closed field, things are starting to change. There is a growing trend towards opening the source of the experiments among researchers, offering convincing proof for their published papers. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods is appearing on GitHub, popularizing abstruse knowledge. When I started to do research on Ant Colony Optimization, an open-source implementation gave me a big help in programming the framework, and afterwards, to make my own contribution, I also put the improved algorithm in a public repository, hoping that maybe someday, the simple gesture will be of benefit to those in need.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team whose product was an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, relying heavily on the GitHub site. Thanks to my acquaintance with the community, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering played in helping this huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of computer science technology.

With these experiences in hand, my career ambition is to become a researcher in a major technology company, contributing code to exciting open-source projects as well as putting it into profitable production, which was exactly what I would like to do, a bridge between my interest and job.

In my graduate study, I therefore plan to be a contributor of some famous projects to practice skills and gather experience for my career. Following my interview experience at Microsoft, these huge companies warmly welcome star programmers or those who have a voice in any specific areas. But this goal is not going to be easy, because being a contributor of an open-source project requires a deep understanding of its design philosophy as well as professional expertise in Computer Science, including programming, engineering, and even coding styles.

The comprehensive courses in UCI program is a huge boost to me. According to the curriculum setting, following my interview experience at Microsoft, Data Structure and Analysis of Algorithms should prove valuable; I also look forward to studying Machine Learning to strengthen my understanding of data science which is gradually becoming a unique skill in very high demand. As for other two areas, to broaden my horizons, I would like to select four courses in Scientific and Visual Computing as well as Database Systems, where my undergraduate college failed to offer sufficient courses.

The program also provides me with abundant research resources. My research interest is in Artificial Intelligence and I have done several related research in a subdiscipline Swarm Intelligence which mainly solves combinatorial optimization. But for now, under the tide of Big Data, I am more interested in Machine Learning and its applications. For my inclination to a specific field is not so hard, I want to get in touch with more choices so that I can finally find out what I truly love. Among all professors, I prefer to study under the guidance of Professor Pierre Baldi, whose research covers a wide range in Artificial Intelligence. Also his research aims to deal with the real-world problems in Natural Science, which parallels my understanding to Computer Science Technology.

As for employment, CS students at Irvine are blessed to have a wealth of companies. Despite the job fair once per quarter, ZotLink is the most professional website in all the career center I have seen, which help students find their internship or job in every detail. I therefore feel confident that UCI is the place where I can realize my full potential through my future efforts.
