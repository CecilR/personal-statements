# Recommendation Letter from My Advisor
## Outline for Manager

1. Build a tool for the document publishing system to help users preview their publishing result locally (Ability of quick learning and practicing)
2. Develop a management portal for the system to help users better manage their document repository and show status and history of the publishing process (wide-range of technic skills and constant interests and passion to explore new things)
3. Cooperate with other team member in building front-end and back-end systems proactively and participate initiavely in code review to refine the code (Active attitude towards work and strong teamwork consciousness)

To whom it may concern,

I am Ken Chen from Microsoft. As a manager of Mr. Yiyun Yao, I am pleased to recommend him to your excellent program.

----

Mr. Yao was on board when I was not in office, so his first task was given by his mentor and one member in my team, which was to build a local preview tool for our system. Just as a training program, however, Mr. Yao’s work exceeded my expectation. After two weeks, when I first met him, he has already done the first version and tried to perfect it in the new iteration. His ability of quick learning and practicing leaves me a deep impression. With his work, the first demo of our system was completely successful.

Therefore in the following sprint, I asked Mr. Yao to rewrite the whole program in C#, which initially he programmed it with Python for rapid development. I supposed he could finish it within one sprint which last for three weeks, given that he said he didn’t have any relevant experience in C# programming. To my surprise, he finished it quickly just as he developed it with a pre-learnt language. Although his work lacked precision and consistency with the extant codes, he has done quite well as an intern contributing his code to the repository for the first time. After given some suggestion to his code, Mr. Yao progressed fast in his next iteration ofcode. With some further discussion of conventions and styles, he finished this work and checked in his code in less than two weeks.

Mr. Yao enhances his image on me not only in learning ability, but his wide-range of skills as well. His main task during his internship is to build a management portal for the document publishing system, cooperating with another member. This work is fully different from the former one, which requires a solid foundation of Web front-end skills. Mr. Yao’s familiarity with such cutting-edge technology such as Angular.js accelerated the development and he also performed proactively and innovatively in this job. He was willing to express his understanding of the product fluently on the meeting and give instructive suggestions to improve it. The function to show the publishing history and status as a table helped me demonstrate our system vividly in the second demo.

Currently, he is moving to take part in the work of tests, including integration testing and performance testing. This workmay offer him a distinct experience, wholly different from what he learnt in school, which can only be touched in Big Software Company. I am very looking forward to his attendance and achievements in this task.

Mr. Yao’s excellent ability in engineering as well as potential can make him a competitive candidate of your program. I recommend Mr. Yao with no reservation.

Best regards,

Ken Chen
