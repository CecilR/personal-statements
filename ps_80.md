# PS8.0 Apply for UCLA

## Personal Statement

### Content

To use one word to describe me, that will be 'Doer'. Most people around me are amazed at how I indulge in putting my thoughts into practice. This strong impetus origins from satisfaction of playing with what I made myself and witnessing it helping people's life and work.

Computing changed from being more than a hobby when I started at Innovation Class in my high school. I took part in Intel Teen Innovation Competition and won the first prize by developing a system to recognize human gestures by camera. I came up to this idea just because I wanted to play Angry Birds (which was prevalent at that time) using gestures. Through this, I gained extremely large experience in developing something that can really help us in modern life and I found it not so hard as imagined before. No words can describe my feeling of looking at friends and classmates enjoying the software written by me.

The interest in computer science was not dampened after the end of the competition, but grew more and more profound. I began my college life in Software Engineering Major in 2012. With the fast pace of Internet, webcasting service, Twitch.Tv as the famous one, is getting popular. In my second year at Southeast University, I created Shaiguo, a social network website where people did not share pictures or texts, but lives. We, a team of five college students who knew nothing about how to build a webcasting service before, should finish developing this website in 4 weeks, so that our product can be online before the long semester began. By an imagination, it was a challenging undertaking. We tried any methods that can accelerate the development, such as AngularJS in the front-end, Jenkins in Continuous Integration and Git in Source Code Management.

Under my organization and leadership, our team separated into two groups, one to fabricate the embedded flash player and the streaming service, one to build the front-end and back-end of the website. As a team leader, I needed to follow up both sides, solicit the best solution to the encountered problem and organize discussion when opinion was split. The hardest part was in the beginning of development. In one hand, to lay a solid foundation for our project in engineering, I had to taught other four team members how to collaborate through Git to work in parallel; on the other hand, there were the most conflicts and divergence at the outset. We even wasted a whole afternoon time to discuss about the name. It was common for me to sleep only four hours a day during that time, but all was worthy when the harvest came. We managed to set up the first webcast on Shaiguo and all the staffs in the college were watching the live in which I gave a presentation about our marvelous project.

In the meantime, fascinated by the Artificial Intelligence in the movie, I dabbled in research and entered the lab sponsored by Associate Professor Ni who focused on computational intelligence and its applications. I led a research group to explore the application of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) on Robot Path Planning (RPP) and concluded the work to a paper published on CEC2015. In the paper, we discussed about the defect of applying classical ACO directly to solve RPP problem and its reasons, proposed three specific strategies to improve the algorithm and gave convincing experiment results to prove the effectiveness. Our team consulted a great deal of literature, tested multiple possible strategies and analyzed a huge amount of data. This experience gave me the opportunity to see the hard work and patience required by a real researcher and a clear understanding of what the computer scientists are doing. As I said in the beginning, I preferred to do something practical, so I set up my dream to plunge into the industrial field of computer science in the future.

With the thought of materialize the theory I learned from class, I decided to find an internship to fill in gaps in autumn semester of my senior. Fortunately, Microsoft accepted my application because of the outstanding performance in the interview. Despite lack of experience in doing enterprise projects, within two months of joining Microsoft, I was assigned to develop two features independently, which was hardly an intern's . Our team was responsible for enterprise-wide document publishing system, and mine was to generate and show the build log and change log of publishing history. This meant a comprehensive understanding of the whole system from page rendering to data storage as well as qualified me for having rich technical skills, including C# and Javascript. The biggest obstacle met was to deal with the compatibility of repositories from two different source websites, Github and Visual Studio Online (VSO). To make a consistent user interface, I read API reference of both sites for 10 times to ensure I can retrieve the useful data from API responses requested in any situation correctly. Other responsibilities included developing a local preview tool, maintaining the management portal and reviewing other member's code. At Microsoft my internship extended further than coding and debugging, I learnt to propose questions, think critically and balance work and life, such as playing foosball after lunch. I even joined the Visual Studio China Basketball Team as a power forward. This journey elevated myself both in technological and sociable level. Based on this unforgettable experience, I am willing to start my career in technology gaints to build a firm foothold in the industry, including networking and self-improvement.

I apply for UCLA in two reasons. UCLA offers abundant education resources and has many great CS professors who are amazing at teaching. Courses, like Operating Systems Principles by Eggert and Algorithms in System Design/Architecture by Potkonjak, give huge boosts to me in understanding computer science and underpin the foundations for further job hunting. Besides, UCLA has a strong industry connection. Companies love UCLA because of its reputation for being academically rigorous and they also have a voice in curriculum planning. This means that I'll have a higher chance of getting that job from these big corporations because they know what is being taught here. However, my motivation to study computer science exceeds more than being a bolt in a big machine. Through years of experience accumulation, I want to set up my own startups with friends or lead a team in a relative small company. Despite the growing responsibility, this provides me with a larger space to exploit my talents in technology and leadership. Moreover, LA is becoming a new assembly point in California for startups due to the increasing land price of Silicon Valley. I can imagine that, with the international perspective and professional expertise developed at UCLA, I will bring my potential into full play in my future efforts to practice my dreams.
