## Questions in Application

### Research Topics: Please list 2 or 3 scholarly/research topics that are especially interesting to you.

One of my research interest is Natural Language Processing. I am interested in this field because I want to make the current Artificial Intelligence, like Siri and Cortana, more humanize and smart.

Another research interest is Swarm Intelligence. I have studied in Associate Professor Qingjian Niâ€™s Computational Intelligence Lab for three years. I am familiar with the common method in this field, like Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization, and find it useful in solving combinatorial optimization problems. I look forward to delving deep to find its wider range of applications.

### Faculty: Please list the names of 2 or 3 faculty members whose research you find most interesting and with whom you wish to work during your graduate studies.

Professor Milind Tambe and his Teamcore Research Group have made multiple contributions in a wide range of Artificial Intelligence, which most of them solved real-world problems. I enjoy that feeling and wish to further my study in Multi-agent Team Formation in the lab, influenced by my interest in Swarm Intelligence. The diverse research interests in Teamcore Research Group can also provide me with more opportunities to get in touch with different research fields to find what I truly love, for my inclination to a specific field is not so hard.

Professor Gaurav S. Sukhatme works on robotics system and Artificial Intelligence, which parallels my main research work in undergraduate. I am interested in applying Ant Colony Optimization methods into problems in the field of robotics, such as Robot Path Planning. I took several robot-related elective courses, like C in Robot Programming, and served as the leader of LEGO-NXT Lab in my high school. I believe that my related experience will guarantee my performance under the guidance of the professor.

### Research Experience: Describe your pertinent research experience, training and publications. For your Research Experience, please describe in your own words the overall goals, your role in the research project, whether you worked independently or as part of a group and the overall results that you obtained. For publications, please provide the complete reference information that would be included in a scientific journal such as Science, Nature or Cell.

I entered Associate Professor Qingjian Ni's lab in my freshman year at Southeast University. In my second year of college, I led a research group, applying Ant Colony Optimization to Robot Path Planning. We proposed a novel heterogeneous ACO algorithm to improve ACO's quality of solutions and performance in solving such problems. In the algorithm, we used two ant colony with different sensitivity to the pheromone and path selection strategy, and controlled their colony size by the stagnant rate of the searching situation in order to avoid premature convergence. The experiment result of five comparative algorithms in four different-scale environments proved the effectiveness of our method. A paper was published on 2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).

### Statement of Purpose

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join GitHub, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt most of the things I need to become a qualified software engineer from the community.

In the community, I developed a quick and effective way to learn programming. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, I found my passion for programming and my coding skills improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month after joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

I love the community because I tasted the happiness of collaboration through working on it. Once when I took the lead to developed a large live platform, because of my teammates' unfamiliarity to GitHub, at the early stages of development, they felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. With my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks. Our project won First Prize out of forty candidates, but what made me more excited was that for the first time my partners and I have achieved such good cooperation.

After two years' consistent effort on GitHub, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has a significant impact on me in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. While academic research is still a relatively closed field, things are starting to change. There is a growing trend towards opening the details of the experiments among researchers, offering convincing proof for their published papers. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods is appearing on GitHub, popularizing abstruse knowledge. For example, when I started to do research about Swarm Intelligence, a repository on GitHub, Python-Ant-Colony-TSP-Solver, gave me a big help in programming the framework, and afterwards, I also put the improved algorithm in a public repository, hoping that maybe someday, the simple gesture would be of benefit to those in need.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was to publish documents from a git repository, relying heavily on GitHub service. Thanks to my acquaintance with it, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering played in helping the huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of computer science technology.

With these experiences in hand, my career ambition is to become a researcher in a major technology company, contributing code to exciting open-source projects as well as putting it into profitable production. I heard the position on an open-source community session, when a researcher from Huawei shared his work of how to apply Spark to huge data processing in practice and I was completely fascinated. And following my interview experience at Microsoft, huge companies warmly welcome star programmers or those who have a voice in any technological area. In my graduate study, I therefore plan to be a contributor of some famous projects to practice skills and gather experience for my career. But this is never going to be easy, because being the contributor of an open-source project requires a deep understanding of its design philosophy as well as significant expertise from variety of skill sets in Computer Science.

The comprehensive courses provided by the USC program will be a huge boost to me. As far as I know, Department of Computer Science in USC is very large, with abundant education resources, which means I can dabble in many different topics. In the required twelve credits of electives, I look forward to consolidating my technological foundation, for example, in Operating Systems; considering that the Game Development track in USC ranks first in America, courses like Game Engine Developments should also prove valuable; to broaden my horizons, I want to study Machine Learning to strengthen my understanding of data science which is gradually becoming a unique skill in very high demand. Because of USC's reputation of being academically rigorous, these courses will be a great challenge as well as a rare opportunity for me to become better under high pressure. The large scale of department has another advantage that I can easily meet students who share the same interests and we can share struggles as well.

The program also has many incomparable advantage over finding employment. In the curriculum settings, three units can be covered by off-campus internships and I can get a summer internship from more than 150 leading companies in the job fair. There are also plenty of employment-oriented courses to train students' expertise to be used in their career. With all the research I have done, I therefore feel confident that USC is the ideal place where I can realize my full potential.
