## The application requires a personal essay. What makes a good essay?

We are looking for strong evidence that you can do well in our degree program. For example, a description of your research project experience, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. A description of a large software project, your involvement in the project and the impact of the project is good evidence. A historical essay that starts with your first use of computers at age five is not good evidence. Please write the essay yourself. Get help of course, but it should be substantially your own words.

## Statement of Purpose

'Come here, guys, see what we have made!' The shout broke the peace of the classroom where students who intended to took part in the China Adolescent Science & Technology Innovation Contest were busy doing their final preparation. The shout had come from my partner and we had just finished the final round of testing for our project, a system that used human gesture recognition to play games. Other contestants gathered around our workspace, rushing to try 'Doodle Jump' in front of the camera. As the creator of the software, I sat at the side, watching my work bringing happiness to people, with a great sense of pleasure and accomplishment.

Curiosity is what underpins the human instinct to go deep, and so am I in software development. While our project won First Prize for its innovation and usability, however, the system is far from perfect. I found that the recognition rate of gestures was low, and some kind of classification problem was clearly the issue, but I was unable to resolve it until I took certain courses related to Machine Learning, for example Big Data Processing. During the class, my group discussed the Apriori Algorithm, a classic data mining algorithm, and its practical applications. To enhance my understanding, I designed an experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm with voting data for American Congress, and concluded the work into a small paper with many interesting rules. The meticulous preparation of the materials not only earned me a score of 91 for the course, but inspired me to redesign the classification algorithm for the gesture recognition system as well.

Subsequently, in my sophomore year, with an instinct to explore new fields, I set up a research project focusing on improving the recognition rate of human gestures. I applied several supervised Machine Learning algorithms to my system and tested their effectiveness for classifying gestures. Though the training data was not as large as it might have been, the improved method was indeed more accurate and more stable. This simple improvement elevated the project's status from college level to national level, and further opened the gates of Machine Learning to me.

Working in a team is a quick and effective way of digesting new knowledge. To improve my understanding of Machine Learning, three students in my lab and I read the book 'Machine Learning in Practice', which our supervisor had recommended. Every week, we each read a separate part of it, then came together to share what we had learnt, and during this, I also gave a tech talk about how to build a Decision Tree, which received a warm response from the audience. My knowledge in this field was rapidly enriched via this unique mode of learning. Indeed, as I engaged in the activity further, I became increasingly fascinated by Machine Learning, seeing its vast range of applications in diverse fields, from Technology to Finance, its unique potential priming it to become in very high demand, as more and more companies moved to explore large data solutions for their current business.

In addition to my efforts in Machine Learning, my overall technological skills improved significantly during my undergraduate career. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. During my first year in college, for example I have programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore I have also taken an interest in front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; and during this time I have also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. Besides, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which cover a huge range of fields, are a record of the exploration I have made in software development, together giving me an excellent overview of the software world.

For curiosity's sake, I belong to those who frequently emerge fantastic ideas. When I started to write this statement, I asked a question to Siri: 'What kind of students does CMU need?', and was surprised when only confusing and unexpected answers appeared. Perhaps there was no single right answer to this question, but it was interesting that Siri was unable to give any constructive advice, and I asked myself why the Machine Learning technology behind it had failed to do so? It made me think of a similar experience at Microsoft. Working as a member and developer of a team whose products required high performance and stability, I received reports from the test team almost daily, complaining about how our service was slow or even completely down. I could not help but wonder what if Machine Learning could reduce all these drudgeries? With a well-designed learning algorithm, accompanied by a large bank of optimization records and corresponding automation solutions, perhaps someday this dream will become reality. I want to make my own contribution to the realization of Machine Learning solutions because to let programs better help people's lives and jobs has always been a dream of mine since I first learnt to program.

In the field of Machine Learning, I am still a relative novice, but I look forward to becoming more experienced. The Master of Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University is my first choice, for its evidently unceasing efforts to cultivate experts in the field of Data Science. To prepare myself fully for graduate study, I have made an academic plan based on the current development of my knowledge. Using it, I intend to consolidate my foundation in Machine Learning in a systematic way, covering core courses such as Machine Learning and Machine Learning with Big Data Sets; broadening my horizons in the application of Machine Learning with Design and Engineering of Intelligent Info Systems, and Search Engines; and preparing myself for the growing demand for mining of online video content with Large-Scale Multi-media Analysis. Over the 3 elective courses, with the excellent CS-related resource on offer at Carnegie Mellon, I will seek to enrich my knowledge and improve my background further by taking Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures, Operating System Design and Implementation and Compiler Design.

After graduating, I want to bring what I have learnt at Carnegie Mellon into the industry, turning cutting-edge Machine Learning technologies into marketable products. Given the program's prestige, finding employment will no doubt be little trouble, but I am keen to use expertise developed at Carnegie Mellon to the fullest extent. If possible, I would like to eventually position myself as a data analyst with Google. At the awards ceremony for the Google Excellence Scholarship 2015, when a researcher shared his work on how to use the world's largest data set to do cool things, like predicting a movie's box-office revenue, I was completely fascinated by the potential. Google also holds the best translation system in the world, and in areas such as these I can exploit my talent in Machine Learning while also fulfilling my dream of making a more intelligent system to improve people's lives.

With all the research I have done, I am fully confident that the Master of Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential.
