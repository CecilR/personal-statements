# PS8.0 Apply for UCSD

## Statement of Purpose

An applicant's statement of purpose is very important and is given careful consideration in the selection process. There is no specific word limit, but be concise and specific in preparing your statement, giving information that demonstrates your level of preparation and potential for success in graduate school. Applicants should address past accomplishments within the realm of computer science and engineering, why they are qualified for the program, and goals they wish to pursue while in graduate school.

## Content

I was an eighth grader in my secondary school, I was first allowed to touch a computer when I took a course that taught you how to control a robot by programming it. After three years, when I was a high school student, I took part in an interest group. The teacher taught us how to use C to programm a LEGO NXT robot. It was very exciting for to see such fantastic codes which can help the robot walking along the black line. At that time, C code is an secret to me, I know how to write it by simulating the examples but don't know how to use it to create new things.

The time moved to my college age. I was not admitted to my dream school in my hometown. Luckily, because of my own willing, I persuaded my parents to let my choose Software Engineering as the first selection in all the candidate schools to avoid falling into other specialties. When I was in my high school, I had looked forward to get some further education abroad for its better resources and freedom. With my girl friend's advice, I started to prepare the necessary things for going abroad.

So the first thing I came to school was to find an advicor. Fortunately, my head teacher was finding students to help him do some research work. After several conversation and some tests, I was admitted to his lab to do some work related to Swam Intelligence. For some former programming experience in high school, my advisor gave me the first job to help a fellow student write some code on experiments. Although I was not so familiar with the algorithms, I still wrote some scenarios independently by reading the paper and looking up on the Internet. Time moved to the first term of sophomore. The fellow student left the group for some personal affairs, and all the responsibility left to my own. At first, I was rushed, finding nowhere to begin the research by my own. But I was reminded of my initial dream of going abroad to see a bigger world, I started to do some work by simulating the fellow students in the lab, reading papers, doing experiments and writing reports. With the help of my advicor, I selected a small area in Swarm Intelligence about how to apply Ant Colony Optimization into solving Robot Path Planning to do some deeper work. I have done several experiments and analyze the behavior of the algorithms to see some key factors which decrease the accuracy and convergence of the algorithms. I listed several strategies from some published papers which may optimize the classic algorithm and tested them one after one by ground control. During the experiments, I found  there was some balance between the accuracy and convergence rate, and recalled a mutiple colonies strategy which I read in a paper before, then I decided to try to use two colonies in my algorthm, one for controlling the accuracy and one for controlling the convergence rate. After many experiments, I found my algorithms can achieve a much better situation than the classic one in a middle scale, also has an improvement in a high scale. After talking to my advicor, we decided to conclude the results into a paper. Hard work pays off. I managed to publish this paper by the end of junior. At the same time, another preparation had already began.

With some efforts dealing with data structures and algorthms, I managed to become an intern in Microsoft. Fortunately, I was allocated to a newly-set-up team whose project is to build a new document-publishing system to replace the old one with simple and direct operations for user. In the first two months, I was assigned to a job to build a management portal based on front end for our partners to configure their document repositories. The job has been done quickly and successfully and then I started to ask for work actively. Hard work pays off. Finally, I was able to do some work related to our core system which may deals with thousands of queries per second. (BALABALA)

During my graduate, I want to build a general framework to automatically analyze and predict the user actions based on the queries and caching the predicted one to improve the performance. Currently it is not so easy for me because it is related to too many areas of knowledge that I have never touched. Learning by practicing is great but it takes time evolving from the first solution to the best practice. I think the curriculum of the major of CS can help me accelerating this process and lay a solid foundation. Especially courses like Parallel Computer Architecture & Programming, Distributed Systems and Storage Systems can give me chances to learn, practice and see the best solution currently in the industry and its developing trend.

After my graduation, I also want to do the related work in big IT companies. I know Google has some related work and its may also has the requirements. Great websites with large throughput like facebook and twitter may also have the same requirements. Applying what I have done to their current system is the best, however, putting what I learnt in UCSD and my project into the production also works fine for me.

Back to this admission, what I can bring to this program is my personal innovative ideas in this direction and my pursue to build a more stable and high-performance system, and I will try to prove it in my way, learning by practicing. Just like an old saying goes in China, hard work pays off, I believe my research experience, strong background of engineering can make me a competitive candidate for my dream program.
