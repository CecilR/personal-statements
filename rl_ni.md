# Recommendation Letter from My Advisor

To whom it may concern,

Upon Mr.Yiyun Yao's request of recommendation letter and his wishes to pursue master degree at your program, I am very pleased to write this letter in support of his application for his outstanding academic performance in research as well as potential.

I am an associate professor in Southeast University, and my research is in  comptational intelligency and its applications. Mr.Yao is mainly doing the research work related to Ant Colony Optimization and its applications.

Mr.Yao entered my lab in his freshman unlike his peers. As his class teacher, he came to inquiry about the information of my lab after the first class meeting. His initiative and clear target left me a deep impression.

Because of his programming skills learnt in advance, I asked Mr.Yao to attend as an assistant in a research group which lead by two fellow students and try to help implement some classical algorithms of swarm intelligence. The project was initially to discuss the possibility of applying ACO method or its variations to solve the Robot Path Planning problem. He learnt quickly and gave some preliminary results of the experiments to show the feasibility which help this project elevated from the college grade to national grade of Innovation Traning Program.

Mr.Yao is very determined and capable. After two fellow students left the group, he continued the research of this area almost individually. Considering the taxing study workload in sophomore, he persevered in doing research and syncing with me whenever he had new ideas. In the contrast experiments he designed for the project, he implemented five algorithms in four scales of environments, including three of them which required parameter adjustment. It is not easy for an undergraduate student, but he finished it accurately, which made me totally satisfying. The result successfully reflected the feasibilty and advantages of the improved algorithms. He concluded his work into a paper with my help and published it on CEC 2015 as the first writer.

In the contact with Mr.Yao, I found him an innovative and strong-minded student. During the research, I can see many shining points in his thinking to improve the algorithms. In the discussion of design of the modified ACO, he gave me a list of innovative stategies which he think effective, though some of them are unrealistic. He also participated actively in the discussison group held twice a month with the graduate students and gave a talk about some innovative methods in the papers he have recently read.

After working with this prospective young student for three years, I esteem Mr. Yao as one of the best students who have worked in my lab. For his ability in programming, potential in researching and innovation in thinking, he can be an ideal student for your program.

I recommend Mr.Yiyun Yao with no reservation.
