## Statement of Purpose

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join GitHub, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt most of the things I need to become a qualified software engineer from the community.

In the community, I developed a quick and effective way to learn programming. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills was enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship, I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, the figure was reduced to two iterations.

I love the community because I tasted the happiness of collaboration through working on it. For example, when I took the lead to developed a large live platform, because of my teammates' unfamiliarity to GitHub, at the early stages of development, they felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. With my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks. Our project won Second Prize out of forty candidates, but what made me more excited was that for the first time my partners and I have achieved such good cooperation.

After two years' consistent effort on GitHub, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has a significant impact on me in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. While academic research is still a relatively closed field, things are starting to change. More and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods is appearing on GitHub, popularizing abstruse knowledge. For example, when I started to do research about Swarm Intelligence, a repository on GitHub, Python-Ant-Colony-TSP-Solver, gave me a big help in programming the framework, and afterwards, I also put the improved algorithm in a public repository to help those in need. With more and more gestures like this, I believe that open-source community will eventually be a huge boost to Computer Science research.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was to publish documents from a git repository, relying heavily on GitHub service. Thanks to my acquaintance with it, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering play in helping the huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of Software Engineering technology.

With these experiences in hand, my career ambition is to become a software engineer in a major technology company, contributing code to exciting open-source projects as well as putting it into profitable production. I heard the position on an open-source community session, when a researcher from Huawei shared his work of how to apply Spark to huge data processing in practice, and I was completely fascinated. Also following my interview experience, huge companies warmly welcome star programmers or those who have a voice in any technological field. In my graduate study, beside improving background by courses, I therefore plan to become a contributor of some famous open-source projects to practice skills and gather experience for my career. However, this is not going to be easy, because being the contributor of an open-source project requires a deep understanding of its design philosophy as well as significant expertise from variety of skill sets in Software Engineering.

The cutting-edge and practical curriculum setting in this program will be of great benefit to me. Although I have a solid academic foundation, I look forward to consolidating my technological foundation, for example, in How to Write Fast Code; I would like to broaden my horizons and strengthen my understanding of Software Engineering by taking Software Architecture; other core courses like Statistical Discovery and Learning, Analytical Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems and Distributed Systems will be handy tools of mine to develop large software systems.

In addition to program’s comprehensive employment-oriented courses, located at Silicon Valley, SE-SV program has a natural advantage to employment. I can easily secure an onsite interview chance by applying online instead of waiting for the twice-yearly job fairs. Silicon Valley is also known as The Paradise of Entrepreneurs. I am not going to start my own business immediately, but the knowledge learnt here and the relationship with those entrepreneurs will be treasures to me if one day I want to find a large space to exploit my talents.

With all the research I have done, I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at CMU and feel confident that it is the ideal place where I will realize my full potential.
