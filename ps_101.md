# PS 10.1 MSBIC

## The application requires a personal essay for the application. What makes a good essay?

We are looking for strong evidence that you can do well in our degree program. For example, a description of your academic experience, your achievement in these courses project, is good evidence. A description of a software project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the project is good evidence. Please write the essay yourself. Get help of course, but it should be substantially your own words.

Prepare a Statement of Purpose. Type or print neatly a concise one- or two-page statement in this format:

- Part I: Briefly state your objective in pursuing a professional graduate degree in MSBIC. Tell us if you have a particular reason for applying to this degree.
- Part II: Describe your background in fields particularly relevant to your objective. List here any relevant academic, industrial or commercial experience.
- Part III: Include any additional information you wish to supply to the Admissions Committee.

## Statement of Purpose

Curiosity is what underpins the human instinct to explore the world. Of many hobbies I developed as a child, the one that most inspired me was the art of calligraphy. Ten years into my calligraphy practice, I appreciate that every writing style has its own aesthetics. Some styles are fast, energetic and powerful; others remain soft, slow and orderly. When I write a Tang poetry with multiple styles, I learn how to perform a perfect calligraphy work. Under the guidance of my teacher, I was the youngest student to reach the highest level in calligraphy.

It was this same innate curiosity and exploration that I sought out in the calligraphy practice that I have applied to improving my technological skills. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. For example, during my first year of college I have programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore I have taken an interest in front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; and during this time, I have also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate activities in my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which span multiple fields, have served as a record of the exploration I have made in software development, together giving me an excellent overview of the software world.

My vast interest repertoire has been a gift, as well as a challenge. In order to entertain my intellectual recreations, I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.

Curiosity alone has fostered my development of and incursion into frequently developing fantastic ideas. For example, I was watching Arrow on YouTube, and felt uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because I accustomed to lying on a sofa, just like watching TV at home. So I decided to put my idea into reality by participating in hackShanghai 2014, with an app on my smart phone controlling Chrome browser using an extension. My invention surprisingly won Second Prize in the hackathon, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic ideas could also have the potential to come to fruition.

The Master of Biotechnology Innovation and Computation is a very specific program to me with strong attraction for it appropriately satisfies my curiosity to learn new skills. As what the director of department, John Vu, posed on his website ‘I’m not certain what the next big thing will be but I believe it to be located somewhere at the intersection of computer science, the biosciences and healthcare.’, in addition to the strong relationship between modern gene technology and information technology, I focus more on the opportunities coming from the combination of healthcare and computer science. At Microsoft, despite being the driving force in the team, I insisted on going to the gym every day to seek for a work-life balance. Educated by and benefited from a professional fitness coach, I found that many colleagues lacked awareness and methods of fitness, which has already been a common problem for modern commuters.

The tacit combination of academy and industry is another great advantage to employment. I can learn much practical experience from those outstanding instructors with strong backgrounds in both research and engineering. The bridge between theoretical knowledge and applied engineering is what most of other Master's Program failed to offer, but nonetheless the urgent and lacking part for students who aim to find their positions in firms. Through the special core curriculum set in the program, industry advisors will also provide me with some key insights into how business operate, helping me integrate emerging technologies into effective business solutions.
I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at CMU and feel confident that MSBIC is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential.
