## The application requires a personal essay. What makes a good essay?

We are looking for strong evidence that you can do well in our degree program. For example, a description of your research project experience, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. A description of a large software project, your involvement in the project and the impact of the project is good evidence. A historical essay that starts with your first use of computers at age five is not good evidence. Please write the essay yourself. Get help of course, but it should be substantially your own words.

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join Github, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt nearly everything I need to become a qualified software engineer from this community. What it has given to me has exceeded my expectations beyond all measure.

The Github community provided me with a quick and effective way to learn. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on Github. Other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code, and then I would optimize it according to their advice. As I engaged in the activity further, I gain confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, my programming ability has improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month of joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

Through Github, I also tasted the happiness of collaboration in my team project, where I introduced it to my team. In the early stages of development, however, because of its unfamiliarity and alien interface, my teammates felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. However, with my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. I was very satisfied that for the first time my partners and I achieved such good cooperation. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks, our project winning the First Prize.

After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has influenced me deeply in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. Academic research is still a relatively closed field, but things are starting to change. There is a growing trend for researchers to open source experiment data on Github, offering solid proof for their results. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods is appearing, popularizing abstruse knowledge, as with A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python. These breakthroughs were highly conducive to the development of Computer Science. To make my own contribution, I have also published my implementation of algorithms and experiment data on Github. Maybe someday, these simple gestures will be of benefit to those in need.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team (which can be found as an organization on Github). Our product was an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, relying heavily on the Github site. Thanks to my acquaintance with the community, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with Github, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project won high praise from Mr. Jeff, our new department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering played in helping this huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community.

With these experiences in hand, my career ambition is to become a researcher in a major technology company, contributing code to exciting projects in the open-source community as well as putting its technology into profitable production. In my graduate study, I therefore plan to be a contributor of some famous projects to practice skills and gather experience for my career. Under the tide of Big Data, I intend to be the driver behind it, specializing in such projects as scikit-learn, which provides implementation in machine learning, warmly discussed by the industry. The cutting-edge curriculum setting is a huge boost for me to overcome the difficulties of joining halfway. Beside the essential courses, such as the famous Operating System Design and Implementation that has already proved valuable in overall technology improvement, courses like Big Data Analytics, will be very conducive to me, who is ready to plunge myself into data science and technologies. Companied with 12 customized credits and loose course selection limits, I can make a good use of the abundant education resources in the School of Computer Science to hone my abilities, getting prepared for the challenges met in the career.
