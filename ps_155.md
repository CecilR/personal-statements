# PS 15.5 UCI

## Requirement

Applicants for our graduate programs are selected using a holistic evaluation system. This essay will assist both the admissions committee and fellowship review committees to evaluate your preparation for the proposed field of study. In your statement of purpose, please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization.

A sample of topics that you might address in your statement is below. However, please structure your statement in any way that you feel best represents your research interests. Please do note that there is a 1200 word maximum for the statement.

- Academic plans and research interests
- Relevant experience
- Future career goals
- Why UC Irvine would be a good intellectual fit for you

This "Statement of Purpose" is required for all applicants and is different from the "Personal History Statement" that is also required for all applicants who are US Citizens or legal US Permanent Residents. The "Statement of Purpose" is expected to focus on your academic/research experiences and interests while the "Personal History Statement" should focus on your personal background.

In addition to the "Statement of Purpose" and "Personal History Statement", some academic programs require applicants to provide a writing sample. Applicants will be notified about any such requirements by their program and will submit any additional items separately and directly to the program. Check with your department about any such additional requirements.

## Statement of Purpose

Curiosity is what underpins the human instinct to explore the world. Of many hobbies I developed as a child, the one that most inspired me was the art of calligraphy. Ten years into my calligraphy practice, I appreciate that every writing style has its own aesthetics. Some styles are fast, energetic and powerful; others remain soft, slow and orderly. When I write a Tang poetry with multiple styles, I learn how to perform a perfect calligraphy work. Under the guidance of my teacher, I was the youngest student to reach the highest level in calligraphy.

It was this same innate curiosity and exploration that I sought out in the calligraphy practice that I have applied to improving my technological skills. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. For example, during my first year of college I have programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore I have taken an interest in front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; and during this time, I have also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate activities in my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which span multiple fields, have served as a record of the exploration I have made in software development, together giving me an excellent overview of the software world.

My vast interest repertoire has been a gift, as well as a challenge. In order to entertain my intellectual recreations, I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.

Curiosity alone has fostered my development of and incursion into frequently developing fantastic ideas. For example, I was watching Arrow on YouTube, and felt uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because I accustomed to lying on a sofa, just like watching TV at home. So I decided to put my idea into reality by participating in hackShanghai 2014, with an app on my smart phone controlling Chrome browser using an extension. My invention surprisingly won Second Prize in the hackathon, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic ideas could also have the potential to come to fruition.

As I write this statement, another fantastic idea is coming to me. When I began writing, I asked Siri: 'What kind of students does UCI need?', and was surprised when only confusing and unexpected answers appeared. Perhaps there was no single right answer to this question, but it was interesting that Siri was unable to give any constructive advice. I thought to myself why Artificial Intelligence had failed to do so? It prompted my recollection of a similar experience at Microsoft. Working as a member in a team of developers whose product required high performance and stability, I received reports from the test team almost daily, complaining about how our service was slow or down. I could not help but wonder if Machine Learning could reduce all these drudgeries. With a well-designed learning algorithm, accompanied by a large bank of optimization records and corresponding automation solutions, perhaps someday this dream will become reality. I want to make my own contribution to the realization of Machine Learning solutions, because it is this ability of software to help people in their lives and jobs that drives my interest in Computer Science.

In the field of Machine Learning, I am still a relative novice, but I look forward to becoming more experienced. UCI has the world-class education resource in Machine Learning, which can help me overcome the difficulty of joining halfway. I intend to study Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to consolidate my foundation in this field; similarly, as the main method to construct modern information intelligent systems, Machine Learning should also prove valuable.

UCI is indeed great for Machine Learning and so are the professors in the field. After careful consideration of the faculty, I prefer to study under the guidance of Professor Pierre Baldi, whose interest covers a wide range of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Also his research aims to deal with the real-world problems in Natural Science, which aligns with my understanding of Computer Science technology.

After obtaining my Masterâ€™s degree from UCI, I intend on applying what I learnt into industry, turning cutting-edge Machine Learning technologies into pragmatic products. Computer Science students at UCI are blessed to have a wealth of employment opportunities. Despite the career fair once per quarter, ZotLink is the most professional one in all the career center I have seen, which can help students find their internships or jobs in every detail. In addition, Southern California is touted as the next technology hub. A lot of startups are coming up in the greater Los Angeles area, and offices of many technology giants are being set up here, such as Google, which has started their Irvine office in 2014. I would like to secure a position as a data analyst at Google. At the awards ceremony of the Google Excellence Scholarship 2015, I was completely fascinated by work shard about how to use the world's largest data set to do cool things, like predicting a movie's box-office revenue, which had become very common in this company. Google also holds the best translation system in the world, and in areas such as these I can utilize my talent in Machine Learning while also fulfilling my dream of making better Artificial Intelligence.

I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at UCI and I believe that it is the place where I will realize my full potential.
