# Letter of Recommendation

To whom it may concern,

I am delighted to write this recommendation letter to Mr. Yiyun Yao for the acceptance into your honored master program. As his advisor and class teacher, I have a great opportunity to observe his outstanding academic performance in research and to communicate with him for about three years.

I am an associate professor in Southeast University, and my research mainly focuses on computational intelligence and its applications. Yiyun is doing the research work related to Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and its applications.

Yiyun entered my lab in his first year into university. He came to express his interest in my research area and willingness to join my lab after the first class when I introduced some of my research backgrounds. His initiative and enthusiasm for research left me a deep impression.

I would describe Yiyun as a quick learner. I arranged him to join my research project and required him to implement some classical algorithms of swarm intelligence. He soon gave some preliminary results of the experiments to prove the feasibility. Due to his efficient work, this project upgraded from college-level Innovation Training Program into national-level.

Yiyun’s determination impressed me. Even in the situation that some of his group companions quit in the middle, he still stuck to the research and updated his progresses with me regularly. It is really hard for an undergraduate student to do so. With his effort, he published a paper on CEC 2015 as the first author, showing his potential and capability in this field.

I would regard him as an innovative student with critical thinking. In contact with Yiyun, I can see many sparkling points in his thoughts. Once in a discussion about how to improve ACO, he gave me a list of innovative strategies he believed to be effective. Although some of them seemed to be unrealistic, others provided great aspects for him to further explore. He also participated actively in the group discussion held twice a month with my graduate students, sharing his original ideas and perspectives about the papers he read.

After three years’ continuous contact with Yiyun, I considered him as one of the best students who worked in my lab. Based on my previous experience, his capability and potential in research will surely qualify him worthy asset in your unique program. Therefore, I recommend Yiyun with no reservation. Your favorable consideration will be highly appreciated. Please feel free to contact me if there is any problem.

Sincerely,

Qingjian Ni,
