# PS 6.0 About one of my project experience

This is not the project that achieves the highest reward, either uses latest technology in my project collection. The reason why I take it out is that it leaves me the greatest impression of what troubles my project in my following life and work.

##About the mind of engineering.

The project I was involved in is a software development under Linux platform. Its aim is to made a immediate message tool for the linux user to meet their growing requirements of communication. The project is based on three parts, GUI & client, communication protocols and server. I was the technical leader then however, I was just enjoying the process of writing my code in my style. After one week's development, my development is more and more far from other team member, and our code can harly merged into one project. I try a whole night to merge two projects into one, before the last night. After this experience, I began to reflect my attitude of writing code and running a team to code. First, our team does not a unified code style and naming standard, so that when we both change one file in the project, the source code seems so strange and difficult to maintain. Second, we lack code review, when I finished writing code, I usually checkin my code into the code repository without asking for other people's advice. This is really not a effective way in working with a team. Code review can not only improve the quality of codes, but also strengthen the logic and flow in our project. Third, we lack efficient tool to manage our code, at that time, we only use the folder to save our code in a shared folder, and never merge our code until the last time. No official build machine, not continuous integration, and no codereview system. In this project, we even don't have a server to deploy our server. These three unmanaged aspect make our project in a mess and less maintainable.

##About the learning new things.

I first touched linux system during this project. There are a bunch of new software I have never see before. And the main way to process the system changed. I use the Command Line instead of the Graphic Interface, and use vim & gcc & make instead of IDE. At first, I was very uncomfortable when I worked with these new tools and my efficiency is extremely low at the very beginning. For instance, I can hardly type in a "Hello World" program with vim, while I just need to new a project in Visul Studio under Windows and everything works fine when I click the Run button. This incomvenience follow me for about two months, however, my skill's getting fully improved. And today, I can use the CLI and vim fluently, moreover, all effort I had paid that time gets paid. For now, I can use linux just like I was ussing windows and more effective when programmig. My skills of coding also has a great advance because with all these small basic tool, I started to think programming in a low level, just like people's trying to see the nature and basement of one thing. I knew how the program is complied and linked, how they load into memory and how system manage them. For without learning these new tools and new environments, I may spend more time in finding how programs really works in the computer.

##About the team and share.

I used to think who write more is the best and the stongest, but I found I was wrong. Writing code can never judge whether a engineer is good or not. For example, if a requirements can be finished with 10 lines while I have to write with 30 lines, the maintainence of my code is much worse than that brief one. This situation is much worse when I have to work with a team, because if I write more bad code, my teammates have to spend more time on these codes finding bugs and integrate these bad codes with those good one. Also if I failed to desgin my code and check it in with out thinking carefully, even my code is right, it may have many performance troubles, this problem is implicit but very dangerous.

I could not say I have much experience in building a software, but I don't collect less lessons. These 'better not's let my projects better and better. I believe every truth is challenged by hundreds of thousands of practice, so I will continue my trail to make mistakes and become a real programmer.
