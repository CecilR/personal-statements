It was in 2014 that I first set my foot in industry. Through the experience of working in a startup company, I applied what I learnt in school into practice and germinated the idea of setting up my own business.

To meet the requirement of rapid development, I found a quick and effective way to learn programming. During my internship at the startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.

In addition to technological improvement, I learnt a lot in how to serve as a leader in a startup when working with my friend who was also the CTO of the company. I realized that being the person in charge required not only a strong ability to solve technical problems, but a precise overview and judgment of the product as well. For example, he collected over 60 competitive products and analyzed their overall situation, including technology selection, marketing strategy and its strengths and weaknesses compared to ours. The action led to an accurate delivery to the app market and warm responses from the target users. Besides, I witnessed and benefited from his wisdom of making full use of every one’s advantage. With his clear job assignment and united efforts of five developers, the first mobile game in my company had once ranked 13th of all the paid games in Apple Store.

After one year’s preparation and rounds of selection, I got the opportunity to start a new journey in a company with totally different style. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was to publish documents from a git repository, relying heavily on GitHub service. Thanks to my acquaintance with it, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project got high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

At Microsoft, there were plenty of experienced engineers who were willing to share their opinions and in such environment I developed the ability to see the root of a problem and figure out the most direct way to solve it. For example, I encountered a problem when I was using a third-party library to build a command-line program. Through contacting with several other team leaders, I opened an issue to report the situation directly to its author, expressed my real expectation to the library, and received very clear responses. The author also kindly provided me with a workaround, saving at least 3 hours trawling through the documentation.

Despite my personal extensive study in the open-source world, what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering play in helping the huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology to build prototypes, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community. The virtuous circle brings decades of prosperity to the open-source world, promoting the development of Computer Science technology. I believe that the familiarity with open-source technology will be a huge boost to my graduate study at Carnegie Mellon.

With these professional experiences in hand, I feel confident that I get prepared for my graduate study in MSBIC program. The practice in the startup cultivates my innovation in thinking and perseverance in facing difficulties; while the technology giants experience hones my ability in critical thinking and finding solutions. They both give me confidence and faith to be a good leader in a software project, or even an integral business plan, which guarantees my performance in the core curriculum of MSBIC.

I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at CMU and feel confident that MSBIC is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential.
