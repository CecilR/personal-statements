# PS 9.1

I clearly remember the situation when I first took part in a software development contest. It was the first summer vocation in college. I set up a team with other two classmates. Since we all lived in different places, we failed to find a way to share our work. Therefore, a project required 3 people's joint effort became three individual projects. Everyone wanted his/her production to represent the all, but no one actually can. The project hastily concluded in the end.

That failure shocked me, and pushed me to think about what should be responsible for it. Before I came to the college, I didn't have a real chance to cooperate with others. I was born in an environment where everything should be done by yourself. I read books alone, play games alone and faced challenges alone. Since I first received education, I was told to protect what 'belongs to' me and do not share it with others. However, that was clearly not the case today. During my freshman year, I am always searching for the best practice of collaboration.

Through my efforts, I tasted the happiness of collaboration in my next team project. I began to use Github to collaborate with other 4 teammates. At first, they felt so reluctant, even thinking it will slow down the developing process, but under my serious urge and patient instruction, they started to embrace it gradually and willingly. I felt super satisfied that for the first time my partners and I can have a so tacit cooperation. With the high-efficiency cooperative mode, we managed to programmed 30 thousand lines of code in 2 weeks, making our projects won the first prize.

What this open-source community gave me afterwards exceeded my expectation. Since the first day I joined Github, I have spent more than 30% of my time on it. I nearly learnt everything that is needed to be a qualified software engineer in this community.

This community provides me with an effective way to learn quickly. During my internship in a startup company, I contributed my code by opening pull requests to their code repositories hosted on Github. Other developers left comments to help improve the quality of my code. After 2 weeks' collaboration, I began to comment on other people's code. Through this unique way of teaching and learning bi-directly, my programming ability has been a huge upgrade.

I developed a habit of searching when I touched new fields. When I required a tool to simplify a drudgery, I first searched on Github to see whether there has already existed one to meet my demands. When I want to learn some skills to put my ideas into practice, I can find a well-designed tutorial for novice and try it with just a click on 'fork' button.

I overcame the fear of asking questions through communicating with others in the community. I encountered a problem when I was using a library to build a command-line tool during my internship at Microsoft. I found this project on Github and directly open an issue to ask its author. After a hot discussion with him, I got a satisfied response in one hour, saving at least 3 hours of time reading and understanding the lengthy documentation.

After two years of persistence, I have now 26 original repositories on my Gihtub, 224 contributions to more than 15 projects on Github last year. My technology blog hosted on github.io was visited more than 5000 times. But, the most important thing I got is not the enhancement of ability, but the acknowledgement to the spirit of Open Source. This spirits influenced me deeply in every aspect. I started to share my knowledge and experience. For example, I have opened more than 5 lectures in my department, sharing my successful experience about how to develop software in a team.

The spirits of Open Source also influenced in research. Academic research is still a relatively close field in Computer Science but things are starting to change. There is a growing trend for researchers to open-source their experiment data on Github, making their achievements more convincing. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods appeared, such as A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python, popularizing abstruse knowledge. These breakthroughs were conducive for the development of Computer Science. To make my contribution, I also published my implementation and experiment data on Github. Maybe someday, this simple action can help those in need.

The same change happened gradually in big technology companies. At Microsoft, I work as a developer in Open Publishing Team (you could find this organization on Github, and I am the member of it) in MSDN China. Our product is an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, which strongly depends on Github service. On account of my acquaintance with open-source technology, I soon became the main force of the team. During my six monthsâ€™ internship, I was involved in every corner of the projects related to the interaction of Github. The huge amount of work didn't not beat me down, however, I gain much energy in doing what I love. On the all-hands meeting, Open Publishing was highly evaluated by Jeff, our new headmaster, and what I have done was demoed by my manager, receiving warm responses and constant applauses.

Influenced by Open Source and its magic, my ideal career is to become a researcher in a big IT company, contributing my codes to the phenomenal open-source projects as well as putting these projects into real production to make profits for the company. I learn about this position in a session held by an open-source community in China. The developer from Huawei, who specialized in applying Spark to the problem of huge data processing, shared what they were doing and how they work in usual time. I was fully fascinated by their expression then. After so many experiences accumulated, I finally figured out where I belong and I believe I will never regret for this decision.
