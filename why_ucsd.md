# Why UCSD?

1. good internship placement: [Internship Placement Statistics 2010](http://cse.ucsd.edu/node/231). Finding a job in America is maybe a periodic goal for me in this plan, and an internship for the dream company is the best way to find a dream job. In the CSE of UCSD, the statistics of internship placement is very nice, many of the current student went to the big IT company like Google, Microsoft, Amazon.

2. Offers standard option plan with no research content: a good study plan for a student who wants to find a job immediately after graduation.

4. Why I choose these courses?

Obviously, I want to master some essential skills to find a job. Computer Systems is what I want to dive into depth because these course are mostly important for work which I learnt in my internship. Most of the work in a company requires things around the Computer Systems, including OS, networks, high-perf computation and so on. For present, I will choose Computer Communication Networks which will describes internet protocols and routing functions, Distributed Systems which can help me build a high-perf server architecture pragmatically and  Parallel Computation about parallel programming and processors.

In the elective courses, I want to learn something about algorithms and machine learning. For algorithm, it is a common test for company to selective candidates. For machine learning, it is a trend in computer science.
