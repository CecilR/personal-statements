<p>My research interest is in Artificial Intelligence, which specialize in Natural Language Processing. I haven&apos;t got much related experience, but I am quite interested in this field because I want to make the current Artificial Intelligence, like Siri and Cortana, more humanize and smart.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-research-experience-including-publications">What is your research experience (including publications)?</h3>
<p>I entered Associate Professor Qingjian Ni&apos;s lab in my freshman year at Southeast University. In my second year of college, I led a research group, applying Ant Colony Optimization to Robot Path Planning. We proposed a novel heterogeneous ACO algorithm to improve ACO&apos;s quality of solutions and performance in solving such problems. In the algorithm, we used two ant colony with different sensitivity to the pheromone and path selection strategy and controlled their colony size by the stagnant rate of the searching situation in order to avoid premature convergence. The experiment result of 5 comparative algorithms in 4 different-scale environment proved the effectiveness of our method. A paper was published on 2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).</p>

<p>Professor Roger Levy focuses on theoretical and applied questions in the processing of natural language, which perfectly matches my research interest. How a fixed set of knowledge and resources be deployed to manage uncertainty?  This is the question appeared on the professor&apos;s personal website as well as the question that confuses me for a long time, and I want to find the answer under the guidance of Professor Roger Levy.</p>
<p>While reading Professor Gary Cottrell&apos;s personal website and his lab website GURU, I find him a very nice person with passion and humor. Prof. Gary Cottrell has a wide range of research topics, and what matters to me is his research in deep learning, which could be used to solve the problem of understanding natural language. Also, I find Prof. Gary Cottrell&apos;s lab welcomes students to propose and guide their own research topics and the research interests of his students varies, which leaves me a very good impression. Because my inclination to my research interest is not so hard, I really want to get in touch with more choices so that I can finally find what I truly love.</p>

<h2 id="statement-of-purpose">Statement of Purpose</h2>
<p>Curiosity is human&apos;s original motivation to explore the world. Since my childhood, I have developed variety of hobbies, such as calligraphy, the game of go and sketching. Among them, calligraphy is the longest hobby I&apos;ve stuck with as well as the deepest I&apos;ve understood. During my ten-year practice, I found that every different writing style had its own way to be aesthetic. Sometimes, I had to be soft and slow to keep it in order; while sometimes, I must be fast and energetic to show its power. When I tried to apply multiple writing styles to one poem, I learnt more knowledge on how to write a perfect calligraphy work, making me the youngest to reach the highest level under the guidance of my teacher.</p>
<p>Out of the nature to explore new things, my technology stack grows wide in my undergraduate. Different kinds of repositories in my GitHub are the direct result of my diverse learning path. For example, during my first year in college I programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore, I started to be interested in the front-end development, taking advantage of the cutting-edge framework, such as Angular.js; I was fond of developing Android apps to facilitate my daily life, like counting the number of my push-ups. These projects, which hardly belonged to the same field, recorded my exploration and try in software development, giving me an overview of the software world.</p>
<p>Being interested in so many various areas is a gift as well as a challenge, so I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company&apos;s repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, I found the passion of programming and my coding skills have improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month after joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.</p>
<p>Maybe for the curiosity, I belong to those who frequently emerge fantastic ideas. Once when I was watching Arrow on YouTube, I felt super uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because what I imagine was that I was lying in a sofa, just like watching TV at home. I put it into reality in a hackathon with an app in my smart phone controlling Chrome by an extension. This invention surprisingly won the Second Prize in the competition, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic idea could have strong power as well.</p>
<p>Now, another fantastic idea is forming in my mind. When I started to write this article, I asked Cortana a question &#x2018;What kind of students does UCSD need?&#x2019;, and clearly it provided me with many confusing answers that I didn&#x2019;t expect. Perhaps the question never had a right answer, but basically Cortana can offer some constructive advice. I asked myself why Artificial Intelligence failed to do that for me? The question reminds me of a similar experience at Microsoft. I worked as a member and developer in a team, whose product required high performance and stability, so almost every day we received reports from the test team, complaining about how our service was slow or even down. I can&apos;t help but wonder what if the drudgeries could be reduced by programs? This has always been a dream in my mind since I first learned to program. Let programs better help people&#x2019;s life and work, giving them abilities to assist us.</p>
<p>Unlike other fantastic ideas I had before, I know that this time is quite different. Following my experience in research, if I am going to make my idea come true, there are plenty of things to learn in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I did research about Swarm Intelligence in my undergraduate, but now I am more interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is the first step to allow machines to understand human beings.</p>
<p>UCSD has the state-of-the-art NLP technology and world-class education resource in the world, which can help me overcome the difficulties of joining halfway. To get full preparation for my graduate study, I have made an academic plan, based on my current knowledge and interests. In the breadth requirements, I look forward to consolidating my technological foundation, for example, in Algorithm Design and Analysis, Operating Systems and Machine Learning. In the depth requirements, Artificial Intelligence track is clearly my first choice, so in the available 12 units, Machine Learning Theory can explain the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning to strengthen my understanding of it; in Statistical Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Modeling, I can learn the modern approaches to NLP to improve my insufficient background in the field. Besides the 4 units of research in the electives, I would like to enrich my knowledge and broaden my horizons by Interaction Design Research, Database System Implementation and Selected Topics in Graphics.</p>
<p>With the significant NLP research in UCSD, I intend to pursue a research project with an advisor. Among all professors, I am most interested in Professor Roger Levy who focuses on theoretical and applied questions in the processing of natural language, which perfectly matches my research interest. How a fixed set of knowledge and resources be deployed to manage uncertainty? This is the question appeared on the professor&apos;s personal website as well as the question that confuses me for a long time, and I want to find out the answer under the guidance of Professor Roger Levy.</p>
<p>After graduation, I want to put what I gained in UCSD into the industry, turning the cutting-edge NLP technologies into products, because after all I am solving a real-world problem and its audience is the general public. As the NLP, together with its required knowledge like Machine Learning, is gradually becoming a unique skill set in very high demand, I feel confident that the professional expertise developed at UCSD is conducive to employment. According to statistics, I found big corporations, like Google and Microsoft, prefer students from this program. There are multiple job fairs per year where most companies from startups to big names come to recruit. Aside from big job fairs, I can also secure interview chances from tech talks and hackathons held by them.</p>
<p>San Diego is a very beautiful harbor city with mild year-round climate and extensive beaches. I look forward to further my study in this city and I believe that UCSD is the place where I can realize my full potential though my future efforts.</p>
