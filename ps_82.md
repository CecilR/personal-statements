'Come on, guys, see what we have made!' a shout broke the peace in the classroom, where almost all the students in the first pilot class in scientific and technological innovation in Shanghai were busy geting the last preparation for the China Adolescents Science & Technology Innovation Contest (CASTIC). The shout was given by my partner and we have just finished the final round of test for our system which can recognize human gestures to play simple games. My classmates gathered around our working table, rushing to try 'Doodle Jump' in front of the camera, while I, as the creator of this software, sat on the side and witnessed my work bringing happiness to people, with pleasure and sense of accomplishment.

This happend in 2011 when I first came to know what is software, how it was created and what they brought us. After four years, the boy, who indulged in codes day and night then, became ambitious and skilled, but his thirst for knowledge and interests in programming didn't change. For inner thoughts, my dream is to become an engineer with excellent ability in solving problems as well as a wide range of skills to deal with variety of problems.

With the fast pace of Internet, the greatest change to people's life style in the four years I was growing up, technologies around Internet, like Web, bloomed and gradually become necessary skills to the practitioners. To strengthen my background as well as inspired by popularity of webcasting, in my second year at Southeast University, I created Shaiguo, a social network website where people did not share pictures or texts, but lives. We, a team of five college students who knew nothing about how to build a webcasting service before, should finish developing this website in 4 weeks, so that our product can be online before the long semester began. By an imagination, it was a challenging undertaking. I tried any methods that are conducive to accelerate the development, such as AngularJS in front-end, Jenkins in continuous integration and Git in source control. The hardest part was in the beginning of development. In one hand, to lay a solid foundation for our project in engineering, I taught other four members how to collaborate through Git to work in parallel; on the other hand, there were the most conflicts and divergence at the outset, for instance, we have wasted a whole afternoon time to discuss about the name. It was common for me to sleep only four hours a day during that time, but all was worthy when the harvest came. We managed to set up the first webcast on Shaiguo and all 300 staffs in the college were watching the live in which I gave a presentation to introduce our marvelous project.
