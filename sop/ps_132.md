# Stanford - Ver 13.2

Curiosity is human's original motivation to explore the world. I have developed variety of hobbies since my childhood, such as calligraphy, the game of go and sketching. Among them, calligraphy is the longest hobby I've stuck with as well as the deepest I’ve understood. During my ten-year practice, I found that every different writing style had its own way to be aesthetic. Sometimes, I had to be soft and slow to keep it in order; while sometimes, I must be fast and energetic to show its power. When I tried multiple writing styles on one poem to find the best, I learnt more knowledge on how to write a perfect calligraphy work, making me the youngest to reach the highest level under the guidance of my teacher.

Out of the nature to explore new things, my technology stack grows wide in my undergraduate. Different kinds of repositories in my Github are the direct result of my diverse learning trace. For example, during my first year in college I programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore, I started to be interested in the front-end development, taking advantage of the cutting-edge front-end framework like Angular.js; I was fond of developing Android apps to facilitate my daily life, like counting the number of my push-ups. These projects, which hardly belong to the same field, recorded my exploration and trial in software development, giving me a general outlook to the world of software.

Being interested in so many various areas is a gift as well as a challenge, so I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on Github and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, my programming ability has improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month of joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

Maybe for the curiosity, I belong to those who frequently emerge fantastic ideas. Once I was watching Arrow on YouTube, I felt super uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because what I imagine was that I was lying in a sofa, just like watching TV at home. I turned this into reality in a hackathon with an app in my smart phone controlling Chrome by an extension. This invention surprisingly won the Second Prize in the competition, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic idea could also have strong power.

Now, another fantastic idea is forming in my mind. When I started to write this article, I asked Cortana a question 'What kind of student does Stanford need?', and clearly it provided me with many confusing answers that I didn’t expect. Perhaps the question never had a right answer, but basically Cortana can offer some constructive advice. I asked myself why Artificial Intelligence failed to do that for me? This recalls my similar experience at Microsoft. I was working as a member and developer in a team, whose product required high performance and stability, so almost every day we received reports from the test team, complaining about how our service is slow or even down. I can't help but wonder what if I the drudgeries could be reduced by programs? This has always been a dream in my mind since I first learned to program. Let programs better help people’s life and work, giving them abilities to assist us.

Unlike other fantastic ideas I had before, I know that this time is quite different. Following my experience in research, if I am going to make my idea come true, there are plenty of things to learn. Stanford has the state-of-art Artificial Intelligence technology and education resource in the world, which can help me overcome the difficulty of joining halfway. In Stanford, a place bred countless startups, I can expect to meet students who share the same interest with big imagination, realizing ideas together.

The program’s well-design curriculum setting is another big appeal to me, because it provides me with a systematic way to learn Artificial Intelligence. To get full preparation for my graduate study, I have made a possible study plan, based on my current knowledge and interest. In Requirement 1, I look forward to consolidating my foundation of computing, for example, in Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Design and Analysis of Algorithms; similarly, in Requirement 2, Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques is a huge boost to me, who is ready to plunge myself in this field. I prefer single depth in Requirement 3 to have more credits to focus on what I love, so in the available 27 credits, I intend to choose Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding to deepen my understanding of how modern quantitative techniques applied in analyzing natural languages; Social Information and Network Analysis will provide me with some key insights into how to analyze large-scale network data and reason it. Beside these application-oriented courses, Machine Learning, a course to introduce the general methods in the field, should also prove valuable. As for the other credits, I would like to enrich my knowledge and broaden my horizons by Decision Making under Uncertainty, Mining Massive Data Sets and Algorithmic Game Theory. Research Project in Artificial Intelligence will test my ability of solving real-world problems by methods learnt during my graduate study.

After graduation, I want to bring what I gain in Stanford to the industry, turning the cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technologies into products, because after all, I am solving a real-world problem and its audience is the general public. Located in Silicon Valley, its geometrical advantage to employment is beyond words. Furthermore, as far as I know, Stanford is the most entrepreneurial university, which offers professional courses to help students better set up their companies, so there is no need to be surprised to find that the founders of many famous startups are all from Stanford, including Snapshots and Instagram. I am not going to start my own business immediately, but the knowledge learnt here and the relationship with those entrepreneurs will be treasures to me if one day I want to find a large space to exploit my talents. With all I have investigated, I therefore feel confident that Stanford is the place where I can realize my full potential through my future efforts.
