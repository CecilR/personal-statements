# Letter of Recommendation

To whom it may concern,

I am very pleased to write this recommendation letter in support of Mr. Yiyun Yao's application to your prestigious master program.

Yiyun was my class representative when I was teaching him Principles of Compiler in 2015. This course was very challenging and demanding, which included several course projects and a final paper exam. Yiyun got 98 in this course, who ranked first in the whole college. His excellent performance is on account of his hard work and diligent attitude.

Yiyun's course project left me a deep impression. He built a website to generate diagrams for three automation from an input regular expression. However, the original highest requirements was only to judge whether a string was match to a regular expression. He got the full score due to his innovative and challenging work. Also, Yiyun's work facilitated my later teaching of explaing how regular expressions worked.

With Yiyun's excellent ability and potential, I feel confident that he will continued to succeed in his further studies. I would recommend him with no reservation. If you have any further questions regarding this recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Zhizheng Zhang,

Associate Professor, College of Computer Science and Engineering
