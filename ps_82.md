'Come on, guys, see what we have made!' a shout broke the peace in the classroom, where almost all the students in the first pilot class of scientific and technological innovation in Shanghai were busy geting the last preparation for the China Adolescents Science & Technology Innovation Contest (CASTIC). The shout was given by my partner and we have just finished the final round of test for our system which can recognize human gestures to play simple games. My classmates gathered around our working table, rushing to try 'Doodle Jump' in front of the camera, while I, as the creator of this software, sat on the side and witnessed my work bringing happiness to people, with pleasure and sense of accomplishment.

This happend in 2011 when I first came to know how exactly a program was created and what they brought us. After four years of professional training, the boy, who indulged in codes day and night then, became ambitious and skilled, but his thirst for knowledge and interests in programming didn't change.

My short-term goal is to become an engineer specialized in optimization of performance in a big technology company. I came to notice the concept of performance in an occassional chance when I took part in a competition to develop an online answering system, the most clear memory  of which was that I spent much time in making my website run faster. Out of curiosity about the exact reason of delay, I tried to locate places which cost time longer than normal by printing logs in some key lines of codes and found that delay mainly happened when users fetched their problem list. According to my observation, there were two steps in a regular process, first is to get the problem-id list store in the database and next extract the detailed information, which is inevitable. Therefore, I focused on the optimization of the first step that I designed a function based on hash to generate the list, because I noticed that the relationship between users and problems is analogous to the feature of hash function, that one user always maps to a constant list and one list is allowed but not recommended to two users. This improvement increase the average response time of a certain API by one second, especially when users first entered the system for it also save time in storing the list. Besides, to further reduce the number of database calls, I store the past time in the memory instead of database by using Memcached service. Through this, I gained extremely large hands on experience in how to build high-performance system and germinated the idea to be a specialist in this area in the future.

In addition to find a solution in engineering, I dabbled in research as well. I entered the lab sponsored by Associate Professor Ni who focused on computational intelligence. I led a group to explore the application of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) on Robot Path Planning (RPP) and concluded the work into a paper published on CEC2015. I designed three specific strategies to improve the performance of ACO and gave convincing experiment results to prove their effectiveness. This experience broaden my horizon and told me that there was still a big margin of improvement in the performance of computing and strengthened my faith to do a correlated work.

With the thought of materialize the theory I learned from class, I worked as an intern with the Visual Studio Steam at Microsoft. Despite lack of experience in doing enterprise projects, within two months of joining Microsoft, I was assigned to develop two features independently, which was hardly an intern's job. Our team was responsible for enterprise-wide document publishing system, while mine was to generate and show the build log and change log of publishing history. This meant a comprehensive understanding of the whole system from page rendering to data storage as well as qualified me for having rich technical skills, including knowledge in C#, Javascript and Database. The biggest obstacle met was to deal with the compatibility of repositories from two different source websites, Github and Visual Studio Online (VSO). To make a consistent user interface, I read API reference of both sites for 10 times to ensure I can retrieve useful data from the API responses requested in any situation correctly.

At Microsoft my internship extended further than pure programming. I learnt to keep work-life balance, such as playing foosball after lunch. I was the only intern who joined the Visual Studio China Basketball Team. This journey elevated myself both in technological and sociable level. Based on this unforgettable experience, I am willing to start my career in technology giants to build a firm foothold in the industry, including networking and self-improvement.

I apply for UCLA in two reasons. UCLA offers abundant education resources and has many excellent CS professors who are amazing at teaching. Courses, like Operating Systems Principles by Eggert and Algorithms in System Design/Architecture by Potkonjak, not only give huge boosts to me in understanding computer science, but also underpin the foundations for job hunting. Besides, UCLA has a strong industry connection. Companies love UCLA because of its reputation for being academically rigorous and they also have a voice in curriculum planning. This means that I'll have a higher chance of getting that job from these big corporations because they know what is being taught here, which are clearly conducive to my short-term goal.

However, my career goal exceeds more than being a bolt on a big machine. Through years of experience accumulated, I want to lead a technical team in a startup company. During the intership in Microsoft, I witnessed how a well-designed performance test system facilitated developers by which I could receive real-time report automatically when performance abnormal occurred and locate the congestion by simply typing some conditions. The profession of the the system broadened my horizon as well as inspired me with many ideas about what I want to do in the future. My long-term career goal is to build a system which enhances the current automation in three phases: first, detect the particular lines of code which cause the congestions; second, gave constructive suggestions of optimization; finally, automatically improve the performance even with inefficient code.

Despite the growing responsibility, the startup provides me with larger space to exploit my talents in technology as well as a greater opportunity to turn ideas into products. Moreover, Los Angeles is becoming a new assembly point in California for startups due to the increasing land price of Silicon Valley. I can imagine that, with the international perspective and professional expertise developed at UCLA, I will bring my potential into full play in my future efforts to practice my dreams.
