# PS5.0 About my research

There is a time before my college, I greatly want to be a scientist. This position has ever been in a Chinese students' dream. This is not because how I greatly want to devote my life into one particular science area and try to discover something that might change the world and the people, but I don't know what I can be in the future. I may be one of the highly educated, and I may use my knowlege to make a living. And? what kind of job need what I have learnt, the answer is scientists which is widely respected by the public in my sight that time.

Afterwards, another story begins. I came into my college and studied Software Engineering. Unlike other students, I have some programming experience before and therefore I don't need to pay so much effort in debugging and trying to finish the C++ homework. So, I decide to challenge myself to do something further and difficult and begin my first formal reseach experience.

In my college, altogetehr with the Computer Science College, there are four labs which accepts undergraduate students. They are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Graphics and Compter Networks. At that time, I hardly know anything about these four areas, but I know AI is cool. There are so many reports and information on newspaper and internet say how AI changes our lifes. And fortunately, the advisor was also seeking students to helo him do some science research. After several conversations, I decided to have a try.

I should say I am not so inspired by what I am going to do. First, I resisted in reading English papers. The advisor first gave me three English paper and asked me to read it. This is the first time for me to read such a large quantity of English materials except in the English Reading Exam. I was feared and postpone the reading for half of the semester. Second, the area is not so cool as I expected. The advisor's area is Swarm Intelligence, whose methods is trying to solve some NP-hard problem in a different way so as to improve the performance, but what I expected is to do something cool like talking robots or great brains. I nearly abort before I was asked to join a project in his lab. The advisor wanted me to join the team and use my programming skills to help the fellow students with some experiments. I accept this invitation happly because at that time I think coding is more useful and interesting than reading documents and papers.

However, for some personal affairs, the senior students leave the group and there is no one in the group except me. The great task was left to me, and the projects have already been upgraded to a higher level and the advisor also looked forward to the result of this project. The only happy information for me is that I still have time and I say to myself, if there is nothing to hide, why not go head and try to solve with smiles. After a whole year gap, I restart my readings, however this time, I read it more determinately and more carefully. And I found myself not so resistant to these English papers and I enjoyed trying to repeat the algorithms introduced in those paper. For the requirements of our expected experiments, I have to implement the classic algorithms and find some ways to reinvent so that the new method is able to reused in some other similar fields. The implementation of the classic methods is not easy for some parameters is difficult to adjust. Once in the experiment, I can't find the correct settings of parameters of the algorithm, the result is far from the the expected one recorded in the paper. After a long time of trial without a clue, I decide to find out why. First is to check whether my program is implemented rightly, and checking it for several times, I am quite sure about the flow. The second step is to find the impact of every parameter. However, there are 4 out of 6 parameters I have tested doesnot have any impact of the algorithm. Why? I asked myself, I rarely found this phenomenon in my experiment, I reread the paper again and found the data set I used is a large one that I used in my algorithms, but with such a big dataset, the performance of the classic methods degrade quickly so as not to found an answer in a period of time, also called as coverge in the Evolutionary Computing, which is a general reference of such methods. With this unexpected findings, I picked up this point of improvement and made my algorithm more plausible under an environment of big dataset.

With so many efforts been made, it's time for collection. I documented every recorded in the experiments and compare them with the classic ones. My algorithms is faster and more accurate in finding optimals in some particular fields. And with the training of reading papers, I finished my first paper without hesitation. Though there are many tough days, like articulating the logic of paper, learning latex and using more formal words, I all concurred it with my patience and diligence. With effort of my advisor and me, my paper was eventually accepted by Conference of Evolutionary Computing 2015, which is one of the leading conference in the field of evolutionary computation. As an old saying goes, the process is tortuous, but the result is good.

Reviewing my research experience, it is really not a happy experience for me, but I learnt a lot and trained myself in the process. I learnt some experience in research, such as how to do a field research, how to setup an experiment and how to write a formal English paper. But in my perspective, I think the research experience changed my mind. In one aspect, I change my mind upon coding and reading documents, they are both important. Without either of them, never can I be a top research guy. In another aspect, I know what a scientists' work really are. They are never the one I expect in my childhood, but tougher and less respective.
